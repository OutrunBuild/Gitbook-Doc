# DeSocial (Future)

In the **Web1** era, users were primarily consumers of content rather than creators. Control over content and data was concentrated in the hands of a few platforms, and the economic benefits generated belonged entirely to these platforms. With the advent of the **Web2** era, users not only consumed content but also became creators. Nonetheless, large platforms continued to hold the reins of data and content, with economic benefits distributed between the platforms and some creators.

However, we are now moving towards the **Web3** era, whose core belief is to achieve decentralization through blockchain technology, empowering users with more control over their own data and identity, and ensuring that the value created by user-generated content is fairly distributed to every participant in the community. Among existing Dapps, we have yet to find one that truly embodies our vision for Web3. If only a select few continue to benefit, how does this differ from Web2?

**DeSocial** is the new frontier that Outrun is set to explore. After gaining a deep understanding of **OutStake**, **OutSwap**, **FFLaunch**, and **Memeverse**, if you possess keen insight, you will discover that the products and economic models of the Outrun ecosystem have tremendous potential for expansion. Our next goal is to redefine DeSocial by introducing **a new mechanism for benefit distribution, a sustainable economic model, and a unique user interaction experienceï¼š**

Based on the sustainable economic models of **Creator Token**, **Creator Token Vault**, and **FFLaunch**, we plan to expand the Outrun ecosystem into various social domains, including **microblogging**, **short videos**, **live streaming**, **communities**, and **membership subscription platforms.**&#x20;

**The creator issues creator tokens through the FFLaunch method. The UPT portion of the market-making income from the locked genesis liquidity belongs to the creator, while the creator token portion of the market-making income is injected into the creator token yield vault. Additionally, a portion of the creator's tip income, subscription income, advertising income, etc., will be used to repurchase creator tokens and inject them into the creator token yield vault.**

Under this social economic model, the stakeholders are no longer limited to just the platform and the creator; consumers are also introduced. As community users, consumers can **stake creator tokens to share in the income of both the creator and the platform**. By **ensuring the alignment of interests among consumers, creators, and the platform**, we aim to achieve a **win-win-win situation** for all three parties.
