# Minting

Users receive yield-bearing assets when they deposit funds into a yield-source. For example, BNB staked in Lista is represented as _slisBNB_. ETH staked in StakeStone is represented as _Stone_.

slisBNB and Stone are examples of yield-bearing tokens.

In OutStake, yield-bearing tokens can be split into three parts: Principal Token (UPT), Yield Token (YT), and Position Option Token (POT). UPT represents the principal portion of the yield-bearing token, YT represents the rights to all interest earnings from that asset, and POT represents the position’s redemption rights upon maturity. UPT, YT, and POT can all be traded within the Outrun ecosystem.

Users can stake yield-bearing assets (e.g., stETH) in OutStake to mint UPT, YT, and POT. The underlying assets (e.g., ETH) will automatically convert to yield-bearing assets before staking.

For example: ETH → stETH → SY-stETH → (UPT-stETH + YT-stETH + POT-stETH).
