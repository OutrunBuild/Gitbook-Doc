# Outrun

**Outrun** is committed to becoming a **pioneer** in the next-generation **DeFi** and **Web3** industries. Currently, it consists of four modules: **OutStake**, **OutSwap**, **FFLaunch** and **Memeverse**. It encompasses **yield tokenization**, **liquid staking derivatives**, **decentralized exchanges**, **next-generation token financing paradigm** and **MemeFi(DAO)**.

* **OutStake** is a protocol built entirely around **yield-bearing tokens**, introducing a new type of **non-USD stablecoin** model that is tied to the yield rate. This protocol employs an innovative economic model that, compared to other yield token protocols in the market (such as Pendle), offers **greater flexibility and composability**, providing **higher returns and multiple sources of income**. The assets supported by OutStake form the foundational support for the Outrun ecosystem, offering a stable base for the entire ecosystem.
* **OutSwap**'s first version, known as **Outrun AMM**, is built on the **classic AMM** model and includes several innovative improvements. The most significant of these is the built-in on-chain referral commission engine, which offers real-time settlements. Users can refer others to use the Outrun AMM to earn commissions, and the on-chain referral commission engine is highly composable. Anyone can develop their own referral services based on the Outrun AMM to direct liquidity and earn commissions.
* **FFLaunch** is the first "**Risk-Free**" LaunchPad that sets a new standard for **fair and free** launches, representing a **truly community-driven** fundraising paradigm. Investors can receive project tokens for **free** by staking and locking yield-bearing tokens to establish liquidity. Meanwhile, project teams can raise funds from **liquidity provider fees** during the lock-up period. FFLaunch offers open interfaces to support custom launch logic that does not violate the principles of fairness and free access. This model is more **equitable and investor-friendly**, while also enabling project teams to raise sufficient funds.
* **Memeverse** is an omnichain **Memecoin launchpad** and **Memecoin Staking** protocol built based on the concept of **FFLaunch**. Compared with FFLaunch, Memeverse has no entry barriers at all. Memeverse has removed the customizable token generator interface and uses a universal token template to create Memecoins. Users **don't need any programming knowledge** and can complete all the **omnichain** deployments with just one click using our website UI. Creators of Memecoins can obtain the **UPT portion** of the continuous transaction fee income to support the operation of the Memecoin community and the development of practical functions. And each Memecoin has an [ERC4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) **Memeverse vault**, which allows Memecoins to be staked into the vault to obtain staking rewards. The rewards come from the **Memecoin portion** of the transaction fee income as well as other potential revenues.

These products are not independent of each other, they complement and closely intertwine in functionality, linking **yield tokenization**, **liquidity staking derivatives**, **decentralized exchanges**, **next-generation token financing paradigm**, and **Memecoin Staking**. Through their design and **interoperability**, they construct a **complete closed-loop** Outrun ecosystem, providing users with diverse DeFi and Web3 experiences.
