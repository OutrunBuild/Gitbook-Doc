# Simple Introduction

Outrun has built a unique multi-module closed-loop ecosystem that addresses pain points across various scenarios through modular design. Each module performs its specific function while achieving interoperability through data and resource sharing, forming a growth flywheel. This design significantly enhances the network effects of the ecosystem, making it more efficient during growth and expansion.

**OutStake**: A novel yield tokenization and stablecoin model that, compared to Pendle, offers higher yields, greater composability, and improved capital efficiency.

**OutSwap**: A decentralized exchange integrated with a composable native on-chain referral commission engine and a native anti-MEV module.

**FFLaunch**: A revolutionary fair and risk-free token financing method that rebuilds trust between investors and project teams, achieving a win-win outcome.

**Memeverse**: A community consensus launcher built around the concept of "sustainability" and FFLaunch principles, using Memecoin as a fulcrum to drive large-scale adoption of DAOs in both Web3 and the real world.

### **Pain Points Addressed**

**OutStake**: Current tokenized yield protocols, such as Pendle, have PT and YT tokens with expiration dates, poor composability, limited use cases, and fragmented liquidity. They rely on third-party lending protocols to unlock the liquidity of yield-bearing assets, resulting in low capital efficiency and no real yield generation. The OutStake module addresses these issues by creating perpetual PT and YT tokens, ensuring continuous liquidity throughout their lifecycle and offering enhanced composability. Additionally, we introduced UPT, a universal PT token that bridges liquidity between different yield-bearing assets with the same underlying asset. UPT also functions as a stablecoin, allowing users to unlock asset liquidity while retaining interest from yield-bearing assets without relying on third-party lending protocols or paying interest, significantly improving capital efficiency.

**FFLaunch**: Current community fundraising platforms struggle to achieve a win-win-win outcome for project teams, investors, and the secondary market, often falling into a trap of mutual gaming and exploitation. Investors face constant risks of project teams "rug pulling," while the secondary market fears selling pressure from project teams and investors. This creates a significant trust gap, causing community fundraising platforms to lose their financing function: investors lack confidence to participate, the secondary market is reluctant to absorb tokens, token issuances frequently break, and projects genuinely needing funds struggle to secure support, leading to a lose-lose-lose situation for project teams, investors, and the market. The FFLaunch module, through its innovative "risk-free LaunchPad" design, eliminates the risk of rug pulls by project teams (protecting investors with free access to project tokens), mitigates the risk of project teams and investors dumping on the secondary market (protecting the secondary market), and provides project teams with a sustainable funding stream to accelerate development, achieving a win-win-win outcome.

**Memeverse**: The native value of Web3 lies in its decentralized, transparent, and programmable trust mechanisms. DAOs, as a community governance model embodying these values, remain largely untapped. The primary reason is that DAOs are essentially a social experiment requiring extensive sample data to optimize their development path and drive widespread adoption. To address this, Outrun designed an innovative community consensus launcher, Memeverse, to rapidly build decentralized communities. By integrating with DeFi and Memecoin—the most community-driven assets—Memeverse transforms Memecoin from a purely speculative asset into a community asset with sustainable value. This serves as a fulcrum to accelerate the iteration and evolution of DAOs as a new model for human collaboration.

### **Summary**

If you find it complex, it’s because you’re **thinking from a dev’s perspective rather than the user’s**. You might believe that the complexity of DeFi projects is a barrier to user experience, but the reality is quite the opposite: users don’t care about the system’s complexity; they only focus on simple, intuitive interactions. Just like when using a mobile app, you don’t need to understand the operating system’s call chain; when using an aggregator exchange, you only care about the maximum tradable amount and returns, not which DEXs are integrated under the hood. When using lending or yield protocols, no matter how complex the underlying system is, you only care about interest rates and APY. Similarly, in the Outrun ecosystem, users only need to focus on the interaction in front of them, not the simultaneous interactions of all four modules—for example, when using Memeverse, the collaboration between OutStake and OutSwap happens seamlessly in the background, delivering a smooth experience. This user-centric design makes complex technology transparent to users, lowering the barrier to entry and enhancing appeal, as users only care about metrics relevant to them.

Another issue is that a standalone module struggles to drive growth. For a DeFi project to succeed, it must build a growth flywheel—it’s a must! A standalone OutStake module, without ecosystem support, would struggle to attract TVL, and its revenue potential would be severely limited. The reason is simple: new users lack trust in unfamiliar protocols, and the costs of education and user acquisition are high. Here are a few examples:

Early **Pendle**, launched in **2022**, operated for over a year with little attention. Its single-function design lacked a growth flywheel, and it only gained traction when the **PointFi** trend injected vitality—an external force that pushed Pendle into the spotlight. Pendle also has an AMM module, but it’s not the operational focus, just like ours.

Similarly, countless Uniswap forks on new public chains go unnoticed due to a lack of use cases and ultimately fail.

Look at stablecoin protocols: many have turned into **USD yield protocols**. Users don’t use these stablecoins for settlement or pricing but for farming, with primary returns coming from points or token incentives. Once these subsidies stop, user attrition is inevitable, essentially a repeat of the DeFi 1.0 mining frenzy. This is why **Ethena** has recently focused heavily on ecosystem development—to attract users through use-case scenarios, increase stickiness, and boost protocol revenue.

Then there’s **Lido**, a household name in Web3, with a TVL reaching **tens of billions of dollars**, the highest in the Web3 space. Yet, the protocol is still operating at a loss, with revenue insufficient to cover operational costs, even leading to recent layoffs. ETH staking yields around 3% annually, and Lido takes a 10% commission, meaning **a $10 billion TVL generates only 10 millions in annual revenue**. Lido’s predicament shows that a standalone staking protocol lacks growth potential and must rely on ecosystem collaboration to create diversified revenue streams. Outrun’s ecosystem design is the key to solving this pain point. By integrating modules like OutStake, OutSwap, Memeverse, and FFLaunch, Outrun not only lowers the user entry barrier but also drives a virtuous cycle of TVL growth, user stickiness, and protocol revenue through a flywheel effect. This ecosystem synergy is the essential path for DeFi projects to transition from “ignored” to “widely adopted.”

The Outrun ecosystem may seem to have a lot of components, but it essentially revolves around two core modules: OutStake and Memeverse. The DEX module is now considered infrastructure, initially used to support our own ecosystem. FFLaunch is quite similar to Memeverse, and both FFLaunch and the POL lending market will not be launched immediately, they will be introduced later.
