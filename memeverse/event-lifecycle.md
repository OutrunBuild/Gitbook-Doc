# Event lifecycle

Compared to FFLaunch events, the lifecycle of Memeverse events is simpler, involving only 2 entities and 4 stages.

#### Entities

1. Investors
2. Creator

#### Stages

**1. Preparation Stage**

* The creator inputs the relevant information and sets all the rules for the genesis Memeverse on the Memeverse website UI as prompted. After confirming the creation, the Memeverse immediately enters the genesis stage.

**2. Genesis Stage**

* During the Genesis phase of Memeverse, investors can call the deposit method of the Memeverse contract to stake **native yield token** in Outstake, minting [**PT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/pt.md) and a corresponding amount of Memecoin. **Two-thirds** of the Memecoin will be paired with **80%** of the PT to add liquidity on **Outrun AMM**, with the LP being locked in the Memeverse contract (**50%** of the LP will be **permanently locked**). Additionally, **liquidity proof tokens**, which can be traded, will be minted for the investors. The remaining **one-third** of the Memecoin will be sent directly to the users, while the remaining **20%** of the PT will be added to the **Memeverse Reserve Fund**.
* It is worth noting that to prevent the genesis of Memeverse from becoming too widespread, the accumulated liquidity during the genesis stage must reach a certain threshold to proceed to the next stage. Otherwise, it will continue until enough liquidity is accumulated.

**3. Liquidity Locking Stage**

* After the genesis stage ends, **anyone** can call the Memeverse contract to open the trading switch, allowing Memecoins to be freely traded.
* During this stage, the market-making earnings generated by the LP locked in the Memeverse contract will be **distributed to the creator**. They also enjoy the refund of MEV gas fees generated on the Memecoin (Only [**Blast L2**](https://docs.blast.io/building/guides/gas-fees)). These income forms provide financial support and incentives for the sustained operation of the Memecoin community.
* The Memeverse Reserve Fund will be activatedï¼Œthe benchmark price of Memecoin set in the reserve fund is anchored to the **initial price** at the time of open trading. Users can use the reserve fund to buy back their Memecoin at the initial price or sell Memecoin from the reserve fund. It's important to note that when using the reserve fund to buy back Memecoin, 20% of the Memecoin will be burned first. Conversely, purchasing Memecoin from the reserve fund will incur a **20%** premium, meaning an additional **25%** of fund tokens will be required to purchase Memecoin.

**4. Liquidity Unlocking Stage**

* When the liquidity locking period expires, investors can choose to withdraw their liquidity locked during the genesis stage.
* It's worth noting that it's possible to **unlock liquidity early** even before the liquidity unlocking phase, but only a portion can be unlocked, and the remainder will be **permanently locked**. The unlockable portion dynamically increases based on the locked days, ranging from **(0%, 70%]**, meaning early unlocking will incur a minimum loss of **30%**.

**These stages and entities collectively define the complete lifecycle of Memeverse events, ensuring the security, transparency, and compliance of Memecoin throughout the lifecycle**.
