# Omnichain interoperability

Memeverse is a omnichain module supported by **LayerZero**, allowing users to **register or participate in genesis** on any blockchain that has deployed this module.

To ensure that **each Memeverse's Symbol (identifier) is unique throughout its entire lifecycle (the Symbol being reusable upon the end of the lifecycle)**, the protocol has introduced a registration center to centrally manage the Symbols of omnichain Memeverse. Currently, this registration center is deployed on the **BNB Chain**.

When a user initiates a registration on any blockchain that has deployed the Memeverse module, they need to clearly specify the **target chains (multiple target chains can be specified)**. Subsequently, the protocol will **forward the registration request to the registration center** via cross-chain mechanisms. After receiving the request, the registration center will conduct a series of verification processes. Once all verifications pass, the registration center will initiate **cross-chain registration** operations to the user's specified target chains, **deploy token contracts** on the target chains, and collaborate with the MemeverseLauncher contract on that chain to complete the final registration process, thereby smoothly entering the **genesis stage**.

Every time a Memeverse is successfully registered, an **ERC721 NFT** that **can be transferred** will be minted for the **creator** of the Memeverse on the target chain. The metadata of this NFT is stored on **BNB GreenField**. The address holding this NFT will have the right to claim **the UPT portion of the market-making income generated by the deployed genesis liquidity on the current chain**.
