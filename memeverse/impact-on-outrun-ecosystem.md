# Impact of Memeverse on the Outrun Ecosystem

**Impact on TVL of the Outrun Ecosystem**

In this aspect, Memeverse has a similar impact on the **Outrun** ecosystem as **FFLaunch**, but to an even greater extent, due to the higher activity in **Memecoin** trading. With the presence of the **Memeverse Reserve Fund** and the **permanent locking** of a portion of liquidity, the circulation of **LST (PT)** will be significantly lower than the amount of staked **native yield tokens**.

The increasing demand for **LST (PT)** combined with reduced circulation will lead to a price increase, which in turn attracts more people to stake **native yield tokens** for arbitrage. The **dual growth flywheel** created by **LST (PT**) and **YT** will result in a continuously increasing amount of native yield tokens staked. This scenario represents the **dream vision** for LSD protocols like Lido.

**Use Cases for LST and User Habits**

**Memecoins** have the potential to bring a large number of users into **DeFi**, fostering the habit of using **LST (PT)** among them. This represents the dream scenario for many project teams dissatisfied with **Memecoins**, as they often struggle to find ways to integrate Memecoins with traditional **DeFi**.

Moreover, traditional **DeFi** investors often shy away from the perceived risks associated with **Memecoins**. However, **Memeverse** provides an opportunity to invest in **Memecoins** with extremely **low and manageable risk**. This opens a stable, bidirectional channel between **DeFi** and **Memecoin** users, allowing for mutual conversion.

Overall, **Memeverse**, through its **innovative issuance model, staking yield mechanism, economic support measures, and community-driven force**, offers new perspectives and solutions for the development of Memecoins. These advantages not only help enhance Memecoins' market competitiveness but also promote the industry toward greater **transparency, security, and sustainability**.
