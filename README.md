# Outrun

**Outrun** is committed to becoming a pioneer in the next-generation DeFi and Web3 industries, **driving the expansion of Web3's native value into the real world**. Through innovative yield tokenization, decentralized stablecoins, fair launch models, and community sustainable construction, it unlocks DeFi yields with **higher capital efficiency** for users, while leveraging Memecoin as a pivot to **promote the widespread adoption of DAOs in Web3 and the real world**. The Outrun ecosystem currently comprises five major modules—OutStake, OutSwap, FFLaunch, Memeverse, and POL Lend—encompassing **yield tokenization, stablecoins, DEX, lending, risk-free community financing new paradigms, and Memecoin × DeFi × DAO**.

* **OutStake** is a **yield tokenization** and **stablecoin** module built around **yield-bearing assets**. It employs a novel mathematical model to construct **perpetual** YT and UPT stablecoins, resolving the liquidity fragmentation issues in existing yield tokenization protocols (such as **Pendle**). At the same time, it **captures the native yields** from idle liquidity within the ecosystem, providing stakers with additional yields, thereby greatly enhancing capital efficiency and composability.
* **OutSwap**'s first version, known as **Outrun AMM**, is built on the constant product AMM and includes several innovative improvements. The most important among them is that Outrun AMM integrates the first **real-time settlement** native **on-chain referral commission engine**, allowing anyone to develop their own referral services based on Outrun AMM to guide liquidity and earn commissions.
* **FFLaunch** is the first "**risk-free**" community financing paradigm under the standard of **fair** and **free**. It avoids the risk of project teams rug-pulling (**protecting investors** and **providing free project tokens**), prevents project teams and investors from using the secondary market as an exit for liquidity (**protecting the secondary market**), and enables project teams to obtain **sustainable funding streams** to accelerate development, achieving a **triple-win** outcome.
* **Memeverse** is an omni-chain **community consensus launcher** pivoted on **Memecoin**. By integrating **Memecoin Staking** and **Memecoin DAO Governance**, it transforms Memecoin from a mere speculative asset into a **community asset** with **sustainable value**, while accelerating the iteration and evolution of DAOs as a novel mode of human collaboration. At the same time, it is built on the principles of FFLaunch, enabling users to participate in the Memecoin ecosystem with "**lower risk or even risk-free**," thereby meeting the needs of users with **diverse risk preferences**—even the most conservative investors can **safely** engage in Memecoin ecosystem development, rather than it becoming a battlefield for a tiny elite of PVP experts.
* **POL Lend** is a special **CDP (Collateralized Debt Position)** module within the Outrun ecosystem. Unlike **MakerDAO**, it enables users to conduct "**uncollateralized**" borrowing by **paying only interest** when participating in FFLaunch and Memeverse, providing users with **leverage without liquidation risk**, thereby greatly enhancing the liquidity and capital efficiency of the Outrun ecosystem.

These modules are not independent of each other, they complement and closely intertwine in functionality, linking **yield tokenization**, **decentralized stablecoins**, **decentralized exchanges**, **next-generation token financing paradigm**, and **Memecoin × DeFi × DAO‌**. Through their design and **interoperability**, they construct a **complete closed-loop** Outrun ecosystem, providing users with diverse DeFi and Web3 experiences.
