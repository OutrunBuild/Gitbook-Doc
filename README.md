# ðŸ’¸ Outrun

**Outrun** is a leading **DeFi** solution, dedicated to pioneering the next generation of decentralized finance and the Web3 industry, empowering users with control over their assets. Currently, Outrun ecosystem consists of four modules: **Outstake**, **Outswap**, **FFLaunch** and **Memeverse**.

* **Outstake** is a protocol built entirely around **native yield tokens**, introducing a new type of **non-USD stablecoin** model that is tied to the native yield rate. This protocol employs an innovative economic model that, compared to other yield token protocols in the market (such as Pendle), offers **greater flexibility and composability**, providing **higher returns and multiple sources of income**. The assets supported by Outstake form the foundational support for the Outrun ecosystem, offering a stable base for the entire ecosystem.
* **Outswap**'s first version, known as **Outrun AMM**, is built on the **classic AMM** model and includes several innovative improvements. The most significant of these is the built-in on-chain referral commission engine, which offers real-time settlements. Users can refer others to use the Outrun AMM to earn commissions, and the on-chain referral commission engine is highly composable. Anyone can develop their own referral services based on the Outrun AMM to direct liquidity and earn commissions.
* **FFLaunch** is the first "**Risk-Free**" LaunchPad that sets a new standard for **fair and free** launches, representing a **truly community-driven** fundraising paradigm. Investors can receive project tokens for **free** by staking and locking native yield tokens to establish liquidity. Meanwhile, project teams can raise funds from **liquidity provider fees** during the lock-up period. FFLaunch offers open interfaces to support custom launch logic that does not violate the principles of fairness and free access. This model is more **equitable and investor-friendly**, while also enabling project teams to raise sufficient funds.
* **Memeverse** is a Memecoin launchpad built on the concept of **FFLaunch**. Unlike FFLaunch, Memeverse has no entry barriers and eliminates customizable token generator interfaces, instead using a universal token template to create Memecoins. Users can deploy everything with a single click through the website UI without any programming knowledge. Memecoin creators can earn ongoing **liquidity provider fee** revenue to support the community's operations and the development of utility features. Memeverse completely disrupts the traditional Memecoin issuance model.

These products are not independent of each other, they complement and closely intertwine in functionality, linking **liquidity staking derivatives**, **decentralized exchanges**, **next-generation token financing methods**, and **Memecoins**. Through their design and **interoperability**, they construct a **complete closed-loop** Outrun ecosystem, providing users with diverse DeFi and Web3 experiences.
