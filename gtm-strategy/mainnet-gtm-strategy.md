 # Outrun Mainnet GTM Strategy

## **Executive Summary**

This strategy focuses on the **scalable growth stage after mainnet launch**, with Memeverse as the primary traffic gateway, combined with an innovative points incentive plan and referral engine to achieve viral user growth and business flywheel effects.

## **I. Mainnet Launch Strategy and Product Timeline**

### **Phase 1: Core Product Launch (Mainnet Launch)**

**Release Content**: Officially launch the three core modules: OutStake, OutSwap, and Memeverse.

**Release Highlights**:

- **Mainnet Launch Event**: Host an online launch event, invite industry KOLs, media, and early users to officially announce the product launch.
  - Theme & Narrative: Emphasize the differentiated narrative and demo use case of “higher capital efficiency, fair launch with no risk, Memecoin × DeFi × DAO”.
  - Rhythm: Warm-up (T-7, T-3, T-1) — Launch Day (Keynote + Demo) — Review Week (Replay, Tutorials, Tasks)
  - Messaging & Materials: One-click share posters, short videos, thread templates, media FAQ.
  - Conversion: Launch event tasks (watch replay + complete first interaction) linked directly to points bonus and referral commissions.

- **KOL Collaboration & Promotion**: Collaborate with top KOLs in DeFi and Memecoin fields to quickly expand brand awareness.
  - KOL Tiers: Top (>200k), Regional Strong (50k-200k), Niche Depth (Research/Strategy/Security/Meme)
  - Collaboration Forms: First reviews, tutorial videos, Twitter Space/panel, meme creation contests.
  - Performance Settlement: Multi-metric settlement based on “exposure × leads × conversion (registration/interaction/TVL)” + long-tail sharing.
  - Exclusive Codes & Deeplinks: Each KOL gets a unique referral code/shortlink/UTM, binding on-chain referral commission and points weight.
  - Risk Control: Script and compliance review before creation, stressing “not investment advice”, “fair launch, no insider info”.

- **Partner Promotion**: Co-launch with partner projects and ecosystem (joint branding and resource exchange).
  - Joint Announcements & AMAs: Coordinate joint announcements and AMAs with public chains/infrastructure/DeFi protocols/oracles/security audit partners.
  - Channel Resource Swap: Website/docs/Twitter pin/Telegram/Discord announcements/Newsletter cross-promotion.
  - Product Integration: Wallet discovery, ecosystem navigation, Dapp banner highlights.
  - Incentive Synergy: Joint quests and NFT badges with Galxe/QuestN/Layer3, bilateral points bonus.
  - Foundation Endorsement: Apply for public chain foundation roadshow slots/official retweets/ecosystem grants.

- **Community Campaigns**: Launch points incentive and referral rewards to achieve viral growth through community spreading.
  - Leaderboard Mechanism: Weekly settlement of “trading volume/LP/UPT holding/DAO participation” multi-dimensional points ranking, top 10% get rare badges.
  - Referral Incentives: Actively referring users earn commission and points, with additional rewards for referral milestones.
  - Content UGC: Meme/short video/tutorial/thread creation contests, winners get whitelist and exclusive rewards.
  - Anti-sybil: Address activity scoring + anti-sybil task rules + frequency-based risk account downgrades.

- **Media Matrix Coverage**: Fully cover target users via Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and Web3 information platforms.
  - Media Mix: Leading English media (The Block, DL News), Chinese media (Odaily, ChainCatcher), regional outlets.
  - Rhythm: First deep-dive articles (tech/mechanism differentiation), product tutorials, milestone progress, monthly ecosystem reports.
  - Owned Channels: Official blog/newsletter/Notion knowledge base for searchable content and SEO keywords.
  - Crisis PR Plan: FUD FAQ, tech & security hotline, 24h incident response.

### **Phase 2: Ecosystem Expansion (Within 3 Months After Mainnet)**

**Release Content**: FFLaunch and POL lending markets go live simultaneously.

**Expansion Focus**:

- **FFLaunch**: Provide a tool for community project fundraising and airdrop distribution, allowing investors to get project tokens risk-free.
  - Standardized Issuance: Exclusive/public permissionless modes; exclusive mode requires Outrun team support.
  - Airdrop/FAirdrop Tool: Supports whitelist mode; only whitelisted users can participate in genesis.
  - Launch Rhythm: Feature exclusive mode projects in ecosystem themes (DeFi/Tools/Social/AI) for focused exposure.
  - Partner Distribution: Integrated with wallet discovery, launchpad aggregators, quest platforms (QuestN/Galxe/Layer3) for joint distribution.
  - Risk & Compliance: Exclusive mode requires risk control, issuance template review, team info disclosure, anti-Rug clauses, KYC/audit optional.
  - Data Panel: Project page shows TVL, participants, token unlock info, milestone progress, community health, etc.

- **POL Lending Market**: No-liquidation lending market, directly creating capital, further leveraging capital, serving FFLaunch/Memeverse leveraged genesis.
  - Collateral: POL from genesis can be split into PT/ YT; any PT can be collateral.
  - Global Settlement: During liquidity protection, protocol burns locked PT to redeem UPT principal for repayment, remaining (UPT + paired tokens) go to YT, no manual repayment.
  - Issuance: Protocol issues UPT for lending (like MakerDAO’s DAI minting), reducing external dependence and increasing capital efficiency.
  - Rates & Quotas: Base + dynamic rate; dynamic rate adjusts by project/pool debt milestone.
  - One-click Leverage Genesis: Borrow UPT → participate in FFLaunch/Memeverse genesis → mint POL and split PT & YT → all PT collateralized, YT sent to user.
  - Points Synergy: Leveraged genesis lending also earns points rewards.

## **II. Core Growth Strategy: Multi-Flywheel Synergy (Reference Growth Flywheels)**

### **Overview**

- Use Memeverse/FFLaunch as the traffic gateway, UPT as the liquidity bloodline, OutSwap as trading hub, and OutStake as the yield/stablecoin base, forming a closed-loop growth cycle.
- The goal is for every “genesis/trading/staking” action to naturally trigger growth factors in other modules, amplifying network effects and capital efficiency.

### **Flywheel A: Memeverse → Wrap Stake → OutStake → UPT → Back to Memeverse**

- Entry: Memeverse genesis/trading brings base assets into Wrap Stake (auto 1:1 minting UPT, no YT yield).
- Amplify: Wrap Stake raises Implied Real APY of yield markets, attracting Stake TVL to OutStake.
- Output: Stake TVL mints more UPT, improving liquidity and settlement experience chain-wide.
- Return: New UPT becomes main pairing asset for Memecoin/project tokens, deepening Memeverse genesis/trading.
- Core KPIs: Wrap Stake TVL → OutStake Stake TVL → UPT supply → Memeverse genesis scale/secondary trading volume.

### **Flywheel B: OutSwap Referral Engine × MEV Guard → Volume → LP Income → Depth**

- Entry: Referral links drive trading/market making; MEV Guard boosts fairness and execution quality.
- Amplify: Higher real volume, lower sandwich/sniping risk, increasing LP’s realized APR.
- Output: Deeper UPT/token liquidity, lower slippage, further boosting volume and retention.
- Core KPIs: Volume (with referral share), effective spread/slippage, LP APR, pool depth, active referrer count.

### **Flywheel C: Memeverse(FFLaunch) × POL Lending × Memecoin DAO Governance Accelerator**

- Entry: FFLaunch for standardized issuance; POL lending provides no-liquidation leverage genesis; Memecoin DAO treasury holds UPT long-term (10x points multiplier).
- Amplify: Leverage genesis expands genesis scale and UPT use; DAO participation increases community content and secondary trading.
- Output: More projects/communities launch via FFLaunch, forming a stable “genesis—trade—govern—genesis” supply-side loop.
- Core KPIs: Genesis project count, funds raised, lending utilization/interest, DAO activity (proposals/votes/participating addresses), treasury asset balance.

### **Flywheel D: OutStake Leverage Staking → UPT Adoption → Ecosystem TVL Growth**

- Entry: Users use UPT for cyclic staking/reinvestment, no-liquidation, no loan interest, max net return.
- Amplify: Leverage and compounding boost capital output/unit, attracting more yield/strategy capital.
- Output: Protocol capital efficiency rises, ecosystem TVL grows, UPT’s role as pricing/settlement asset increases.
- Core KPIs: Leverage staking TVL, capital turnover (reinvestment frequency), net annualized return.

### **Execution Playbook (Rolling Iteration)**

- **Cadence Matrix**
  - Weekly: Memeverse batch genesis launch + referral sprint + trading/LP leaderboard (weekly rare badge, points bonus)
  - Biweekly: Thematic activation (e.g. “AI/Tools/Social”), temporary boost to related asset points/referral commissions.
  - Monthly: Ecosystem review & roadmap (new UPT supply, Wrap Stake TVL → Stake TVL conversion, top 20 pair liquidity)
  - Quarterly: Cross-chain/new chain expansion and joint campaigns (foundation endorsement, wallet discovery, joint quests)

- **Key Triggers (Trigger → Parameter Adjustment)**
  - Weak Wrap Stake: If Wrap Stake TVL:Stake TVL < 2.5x (7-day rolling), increase FFLaunch/Memeverse genesis points multiplier until ≥3x.
  - Weak Trading Experience: Top 20 pair median slippage > 0.5% (1,000 UUSD order), open 7-day extra LP points for affected pools.
  - Low Referral Share: Referral volume share <20% (7-day rolling), boost referral points split, add “promotion leaderboard” exposure.
  - Low UPT Pairing Share: New pool UPT pair share <80%, default UI to UPT pair + LP extra points.
  - Low DAO Governance: Last week’s average proposals <0.5, launch “Governance Week” (+50% points), add one-click proposal templates.

- **Incentive Synergy (Points × Referral × Fee)**
  - Weekly/Seasonal: Multi-dimensional points (volume, LP share, UPT holding, DAO votes) and tiered rewards, top 10% get badges + next week 1.2x points.
  - Referral Engine: KOL exclusive codes tied to on-chain commission; upon reaching 50 new valid interactions, extra +25% points bonus.

- **Anti-Sybil & Quality Control**
  - Behavior Anti-Sybil: Daily interaction time, transaction path complexity, fund source aggregation scoring; low-score addresses downgraded or frozen.
  - Task Anti-farming: Task pool randomization + dynamic weights, script pattern recognition, related address merging for scoring.
  - Project Admission (FFLaunch Exclusive): Template review, team disclosure, anti-Rug clause, external audit/KYC optional.

- **Supply-side Ops (Memeverse/FFLaunch Pipeline)**
  - Exclusive FFLaunch (screened/supported): ≥1 “exclusive FFLaunch genesis” per month with theme and joint campaign support.
    - Project pipeline/quota: Sources (foundation/wallet/security firm/hackathon/community), type mix (DeFi/Tool/Social/AI), region/new chain quotas.
    - Basic checks: Team/contract info, issuance checklist, redemption/fee consistency (no heavy risk control; FFLaunch is risky by nature).
    - Launch SOP (T-7 → T0):
      - T-7: Submit issuance params (total, lock period, UPT ratio, whitelist/public), genesis page auto-preview.
      - T-5: Setup tasks/points multiplier, referral attribution, self-test checklist (flow/settlement/FAQ).
      - T-3: Small-scale rehearsal, announcement scheduling, material upload (posters/threads), multi-language scripts.
      - T0: Official launch, real-time participation/TVL/market making revenue estimation.
    - Post-launch light ops:
      - D+1: Publish genesis scale, participants, task completion, FAQ, secondary liquidity suggestions.
      - D+7: Review secondary liquidity/depth, adjust tasks/exposure if needed.
      - D+30: Milestone review, next genesis rhythm connection.
  - Permissionless Pipeline (Memeverse/Public FFLaunch):
    - Self-serve listing: Wallet connect → param form → contract check → auto-gen genesis page.
    - Exposure: New genesis/Hot list/Theme page + referral leaderboard.
    - Community tools: One-click share links, DAO governance tools, referral leaderboards.

- **Org Roles (Prevent Execution Drop-off)**
  - Growth Ops: Cadence, points/referral parameter tuning, data dashboard.
  - Liquidity Manager: LP incentives, pool health, slippage/spread management.
  - Ecosystem Partnerships: Foundation/wallet/quest platform/media/KOL partnership.
  - User & Governance Success: DAO activity, UGC incubation, anti-sybil ops.

   - New user activation rate (registration → first valid interaction <24h)
   - Time to Value (TTV): registration → first trade/genesis/market making
   - Funnel (click → register → connect wallet → first interaction → D7/D30 retention)
   - Retention (D1/D7/D30, by layer: Memecoin/DeFi/Dev)
   - WAU/MAU ratio, avg. session signature count (lower is better)
   - Referral share (attribution UV, referral conversion/genesis share)

2. **Product Metrics**
   - Memecoin/FFLaunch creation count, genesis funds (median/mean)
   - TVL (total/Stake/Wrap Stake/Leverage Staking/OutSwap breakdown)
   - UPT supply and pairing share
   - Volume (total/UPT pairs), avg. order size, slippage P50/P90
   - LP metrics: key pair APR, pool depth, 24h capital turnover
   - Referral volume share (OutSwap), MEV Guard coverage, sandwich rate drop
   - POL Lending: lending volume, interest income, leverage genesis penetration

3. **Community Metrics**
   - Community members (TG/Discord/Twitter), net growth
   - Activity (daily messages, active addresses, governance addresses)
   - Content & spread (threads/videos/UGC, exposure/engagement)
   - Referral conversion rate (referral UV → register → first interaction)
   - Anti-sybil: suspicious address ratio, demotion/bans, task completion authenticity
   - KOL performance: exposure/acquisition cost, TVL/volume/genesis brought in

4. **Ops & Cost Metrics**
   - Points distributed/active users, impact of points multiplier, points cost/protocol revenue
   - Referral commission spend/referral volume, activity ROI (points+commission/new TVL & trading fees)
   - Support/tickets: first response, median resolution time, Top5 FAQ

5. **Reliability & UX**
   - Failed trade rate & retry rate (P50/P90), key flow success (genesis/MM/redeem)
   - Avg. signatures/flow, page to first interaction time (TTFI)
   - Security/stability: contract abnormal events, vulnerabilities/alerts

### **Growth Experiment Framework**

1. **Experiment Goals & Hypotheses**
   - Define business goals (acquisition/activation/retention/TVL/volume/lending utilization), propose testable hypotheses (If-Then)
   - Build “hypothesis backlog”, prioritize with ICE (Impact×Confidence×Ease) or RICE.

2. **Variables & Treatment**
   - Controllables: points multiplier, referral commission, fee (Swap/MM), LP incentive, leverage rate, genesis theme/exposure, default UPT path.
   - Treatment scope: parameter boundaries/step (e.g. points 1.0x→1.2x→1.5x), set safe upper/lower bounds/rate limits.

3. **Experiment Design**
   - Types: A/B, stratified (new/old, region, channel), geo (multi-chain/language/location)
   - Gradual rollout: 5%→25%→50%→100%, set guardrails (auto rollback on trigger)
   - Concurrency rules: avoid parallel on strongly related metrics; sequential on conflicting ones.

4. **Sample Size & Duration**
   - Estimate via historical variance & MDE, cycle must cover 1-2 weeks min.
   - Use aggregate metrics or extend cycle for low base; Bayesian methods if needed.

5. **Metrics System**
   - Primary: directly tied to goal (e.g. registration→first interaction, volume, TVL, lending utilization, net annualized)
   - Secondary: indirect (UPT pair share, referral volume share, task completion)
   - Guardrail: protect (fail rate, slippage, support complaints/retries)

6. **Tracking & Attribution**
   - Frontend tracking + on-chain events + attribution links (UTM/referral code), unified data definition.
   - Ensure full-funnel traceability: click→register→first interaction→TTV.

7. **Execution & Rollout**
   - Freeze window: start/stop at hour/low peak; prepare rollback scripts/alerts.
   - Config mgmt: experiment switches, param tables, whitelist all hot-updatable and traceable.

8. **Realtime Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Leading indicator dashboards (minute/hour): fail rate, slippage, error codes, signatures, latency.
   - Alert thresholds: fail rate >3% or slippage P50 >0.5% → auto downgrade/rollback.

9. **Decision & Promotion**
   - Pass: Primary meets goal, guardrails clear; fail: rollback or re-tune.
   - Promotion path: 50% rollout → full; or keep as “smart scheduling strategy” tier.

10. **Knowledge Base & Reuse**
    - Outputs: standard “experiment cards” (goal/hypothesis/design/metrics/result/conclusion), one-pagers for direct reuse.
    - Fast reuse: public asset library (points/commission/fee param tables, task/announcement templates), one-click reference.
    - Lightweight classification: tag by module (Memeverse/OutSwap/OutStake/FFLaunch/POL Lending) & purpose (acquisition/activation/retention/TVL/volume/lending).
    - Minimal flow: submit→review→archive (EX-YYYYMMDD-module-variable), biweekly review, best ones kept as “strategy tabs”.
    - Searchable: unified keywords/shortlinks, cards with UTM/references, quantify “reuse-driven uplift”.

11. **Experiment Template (Examples)**
    - Points multiplier: Goal=activation↑; Treatment=UPT holding 1.0x→1.2x; Primary=first interaction rate; Secondary=UPT share; Guardrail=points/active user ≤ mean+2σ
    - Referral commission: Goal=referral volume↑; Treatment=commission +5bps; Primary=referral volume share; Guardrail=commission/volume ≤ budget
    - LP incentive: Goal=depth↑; Treatment=Top pool LP points +20%; Primary=depth, slippage; Guardrail=points cost/new fees ≤ threshold
    - Leverage lending rate: Goal=interest↑; Treatment=base/dynamic rate tuning (e.g., base -50bps or utilization curve down); Primary=interest income; Secondary=genesis leverage rate
    - Genesis theme week: Goal=genesis scale↑; Treatment=“AI/Tool” theme + exposure; Primary=genesis funds; Guardrail=fail/complaint rate

12. **Schedule & Concurrency**
    - Biweekly: 1-2 major + 2-3 light parameter experiments; avoid concurrency on same key metric.
    - Versioning: EX-YYYYMMDD-module-variable for traceability/archive.
