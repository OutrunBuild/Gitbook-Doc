# User Growth Strategy

The user growth strategy for the Outrun ecosystem is divided into two parts: on-chain native features and off-chain growth strategies.

### **On-Chain Native Features**

* **FFLaunch and Memeverse** serve as crucial traffic entry points for the Outrun ecosystem, attracting more users and liquidity.
* **Outswap**'s referral commission engine incentivizes user-to-user propagation and can be integrated into other Dapps to introduce more liquidity to Outswap.&#x20;
* **Outstake** supports all assets with native yields. By collaborating with issuers of these assets, it enhances the liquidity and utility of their tokens, fostering a thriving ecosystem and achieving a win-win situation.&#x20;

The aforementioned features are all inherent on-chain characteristics of the Outrun ecosystem. Beyond these, we will also adopt other off-chain user growth strategies.

### **Off-Chain User Growth Strategies**

* **Blast Points and Blast Golds Distribution**: On the Blast L2, these points will be allocated to users who provide liquidity to the Outrun ecosystem, incentivizing their participation.&#x20;
* **Outrun Ecosystem Points Distribution**: Internal points of the Outrun ecosystem will be distributed to active participants in the ecosystem to encourage long-term community engagement.
* **Memecoin Trading Competition**: As assets with high topicality and traffic, we will regularly hold trading competitions and provide social media and liquidity support to the winning Memecoin communities newly created on Memeverse during the competition.&#x20;
* **Formulation of New User Growth Strategies**: In the future, we will formulate new user growth strategies based on market conditions and the protocol's operation.

Through these measures, the Outrun ecosystem will continuously expand its user base and liquidity, further driving its development.
