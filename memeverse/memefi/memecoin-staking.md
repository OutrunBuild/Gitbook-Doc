# Memecoin Staking

### **Memecoin Staking**

Memeverse is not just a token launch platform. It is also a **Memecoin Staking** protocol that perfectly integrates Memecoin with **DeFi**, opening up new revenue channels for Memecoin holders.

Each Memecoin has a corresponding yield vault on the Genesis chain that complies with the **ERC4626** standard. Memecoin holders can deposit their tokens into these vaults to mint **yield-bearing tokens** based on Memecoin. The vault's revenue primarily comes from **the Memecoin portion of the locked-liquidity market-making income** (ERC4626 vault income is limited to Memecoin underlying assets, while the UPT portion belongs to the token creators).

Additionally, Memecoin yield vaults possess strong composability, **allowing the community to introduce additional sources of revenue**. For instance, by developing utilities based on Memecoin (such as social, gaming, AI Agents, etc.), more income can be generated, further enhancing the vaults' revenue potential.

**To further decentralize, the creator's income (the UPT portion of locked liquidity market-making income) will eventually belong to the corresponding Memecoin DAO treasury. The community will participate in governance through Memecoin yield-bearing tokens, controlling the redistribution of treasury income, thereby incentivizing the community to build more practical use cases for Memecoin, and even create more Memecoin SubDAOs, redirecting the income generated into the Memecoin revenue treasury.**

### **Memecoin Restaking**

By depositing Memecoins into their corresponding revenue treasuries, yield-bearing tokens based on Memecoins — **Staked Memecoins** — can be minted. As tokens compliant with the ERC4626 standard, Staked Memecoins can be **Restaking** on [**OutStake**](../../outstake/), further amplifying their DeFi potential and network effects, enhancing capital efficiency, and bringing higher returns to Memecoin holders.

### **Summary**

Users can create a variety of Memecoins on the Memeverse platform, which form part of the Outrun ecosystem. Through the processes of Staking and Restaking, a significant amount of assets are minted for the Outrun ecosystem, enriching its asset diversity and Total Value Locked (TVL).

Through these mechanisms, Memecoin exists not only as a cultural phenomenon but also as an integral part of the DeFi space, providing tangible economic benefits to holders and driving the development of the entire Outrun ecosystem.
