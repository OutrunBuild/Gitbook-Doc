# OutStake

**OutStake** is a protocol entirely built around **yield-bearing tokens**, introducing the first **non-USD stablecoin model** tied to **yields rates**. Compared to other yield token protocols in the market, such as **Pendle**, OutStake offers **greater flexibility, enhanced composability**, and provides **higher returns along with multiple sources of income**. The assets supported by OutStake form the foundational support for the Outrun ecosystem, providing a stable base for the entire system. Specifically, OutStake operates as follows:

1. **A novel staking model based on yield-bearing tokens**: Through OutStake, it controls the yields generated by its yield-bearing tokens and unlocks the liquidity of its staked assets, allowing them to be used in a range of DeFi applications. It adopts a completely new design different from the market, enabling users to mint PT/YT tokens with an **eternal lifecycle**, which offers stronger **composability and flexibility**.
2. **Yield Rate Token (YT)**: The value of the Yield Token is directly correlated with the yieldrate of the yield-bearing asset, fluctuating around the asset's yield rate but gradually exceeding it over the long term. The economic model built around it provides stakers with higher income and multiple revenue streams. It is highly composable, enabling developers to create new products around it, thereby enriching the Outrun ecosystem‌.
3. **Omnichain Universal Principal Token (UPT)**: UPT is an omnichain universal principal token supported by **LayerZero**, enabling seamless transfers across different blockchains to amplify its network effects. **By locking yield-bearing tokens backed by the same underlying asset, the same UPT can be minted** (e.g., staking Stone, wstETH, or rETH can all mint UETH as a principal token). This allows liquidity to be shared among different yield-bearing tokens of the same underlying asset, enhancing the liquidity of similar yield-bearing tokens.
4. **Staking Position (SP)**: This token represents the right to **redeem locked staking positions upon maturity**, created by encapsulating the already minted PT (UPT) into a transferable SP token. Since SP holders can redeem the principal portion of the corresponding position after maturity, different fixed yield rates are formed based on the market price of SP at various points in time. Holding SP allows investors to earn fixed yield income based on the underlying asset‌.
