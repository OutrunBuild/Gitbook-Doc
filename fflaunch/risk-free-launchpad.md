# Risk-Free LaunchPad

We can proudly proclaim that we are the first "**Risk-Free**" LaunchPad in history. For participating users, the risk is extremely low, and they can obtain a risk-free return similar to that of government bonds. Why can we say this?

FFLaunch is renowned for its fairness and zero-cost approach, complemented by the OutStake and Outrun AMM integration to form a closed loop. Compared with various traditional token launch (fundraising) platforms, FFLaunch has solved a fundamental problem: **How to conduct on-chain fundraising before the token is listed while not unlocking the tokens at the same time? In this way, fairness can be truly ensured!**

Traditional platforms usually unlock the project tokens for investors before or at the same time when the tokens are listed after the investors have injected funds. However, the problem this brings is that **when the project tokens are listed, these early investors have already obtained the project tokens in advance**. This **increases the selling pressure** when the project tokens are listed, **raises the risk of insider trading**, and **reduces the investment interest** of subsequent investors, **because all investors are not on the same starting line**.

However, when conducting on-chain financing through FFLaunch, investors will not obtain the project tokens immediately. **All the minted project tokens will be added to the liquidity pool, and investors will receive** [**POL**](proof-of-liquidity-token.md) **tokens with corresponding value**. The POL tokens also have their own liquidity pool and can be traded at any time. Since the POL tokens do not have the right to set their own prices and their value is positively correlated with that of the project tokens, only a small amount of liquidity is required to maintain the normal trading of the POL tokens. In this way, it not only safeguards the interests of investors but also prevents people from obtaining tokens in advance. **Anyone who wants to obtain tokens directly can only purchase them from the liquidity pool, fundamentally avoiding the possibility of insider trading**. This is the real FairLaunch.

During the LP lock period, **the market-making revenue from the liquidity of locked project tokens belongs to the project team**. Upon expiration of the LP lock, investors can withdraw their locked LP by **burning the POL tokens** (or sell them earlier if preferred). For investors, this equates to acquiring project tokens at no cost, while the project team gains continuous revenue flow.

In addition to this, **the market-making revenue generated from the liquidity of locked POL tokens will be permanently burned**. This action reduces the total supply of POL to enhance the depth of the permanent liquidity pool for the corresponding project tokens. At the same time, it decreases the total supply of UPT to increase demand for UPT and attract more people to participate in staking and minting UPT.

### New tokens cannot be released during the liquidity lock period

Under the audit of the token smart contract, all projects launched on FFLaunch **cannot mint or release new tokens** during the LP locking period. New tokens can only be released one week **after the lock period ends**. This means that even if no new buyers purchase the tokens and all investors participating in FFLaunch sell all their tokens after receiving them, within this closed system with no new tokens added, when the LP lock period expires, **investors will regain the tokens they sold**. FFLaunch can **completely prevent Rug Pulls** and allow investors to receive these tokens for **free**.

### A win-win situation for Web3 users and project teams

In this **"Risk-Free"** scenario, the participation funds will exceed those of ordinary LaunchPads. The tokens will receive **ample liquidity support and market attention**, and the project team will earn sufficient fee income, achieving a **win-win situation**.&#x20;
