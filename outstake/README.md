# üè¶ OutStake

**OutStake** is a protocol entirely built around **native yield tokens**, introducing the first **non-USD stablecoin model** tied to **native yield rates**. Compared to other yield token protocols in the market, such as **Pendle**, OutStake offers **greater flexibility, enhanced composability**, and provides **higher returns along with multiple sources of income**. The assets supported by OutStake form the foundational support for the Outrun ecosystem, providing a stable base for the entire system. Specifically, OutStake operates as follows:

1. **A New Staking Model Based on Native Yield Tokens:** OutStake adopts a unique design that allows users to control the native yield generated by their assets. Through OutStake, users can mint Principal Tokens **(UPT)** by staking their assets, thereby unlocking liquidity for their staked assets and utilizing these tokens across a range of DeFi applications.
2. **Native Yield Stablecoin (YT):** The value of the native yield stablecoin is directly tied to the **native yield rate**. The economic model built around it offers stakers higher income and multiple sources of revenue. It is highly composable, allowing developers to create new products around it, thereby enriching the Outrun ecosystem.
3. **Universal asset principal token (UPT)**: UPT is a omnichain universal principal token supported by **LayerZero**, enabling it to be seamlessly transferred across different blockchains to amplify its network effect. The Principal Tokens (PT) of **the same native asset type** can be converted into UPT (such as PT-Stone, PT-stETH, PT-rETH, etc.). This allows the UPT liquidity of different native yield tokens under the same native asset type to be **shared**, thereby enhancing the combinability of UPT and reducing the difficulty of liquidity accumulation for native yield tokens.
4. **Position Option Tokens(POT):** These option tokens represent the right to redeem the **native yield token** at the end of its lock-up period. This option allows users to trade for a fixed interest rate without trading the **UPT** itself, thereby enhancing capital efficiency.
