# Business Model

### I. Introduction: The Dawn of a New DeFi Era

In the rapidly evolving landscape of the digital economy, a well-conceived business model is the cornerstone of any innovative product's success. It not only clearly outlines how the product precisely meets market demands but also charts its path toward sustainable profitability and long-term growth. Outrun, as a pioneer in next-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3, is leveraging its forward-thinking business model to unlock higher, more flexible, and more secure DeFi yields, while injecting unprecedented value and vitality into the Web3 ecosystem. This article will delve into how Outrun's unique ecosystem design allows it to stand out in a fiercely competitive market, positioning it as a pivotal force in the future of Web3.

### II. Outrun's Core Value: The Synergistic Effect of Four Pillars

Outrun's core competitiveness stems from the sophisticated synergy of its four modules: [**OutStake**](outstake/), [**OutSwap**](outswap/), [**FFLaunch**](fflaunch/), and [**Memeverse**](memeverse/). These aren't isolated components; instead, they empower one another, collectively weaving a complete and highly efficient closed-loop ecosystem.

#### A. OutStake: Revolutionizing Yield Tokenization

OutStake aims to completely transform the yield model of traditional interest-bearing assets like **LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens)**, **yield-bearing stablecoins**, and **RWAs (Real World Assets)**. It introduces a yield-linked token model that cleverly unlocks the liquidity of staked assets, allowing them to be widely used across various DeFi scenarios.

**Core Innovations and Market Advantages:**

* **Perpetual Lifecycle Tokens:** Unlike tokens in existing protocols (such as **Pendle**) that have expiration dates, OutStake's [**Principal Tokens (PT)**](outstake/yield-tokenization/pt.md) and [**Yield Tokens (YT)**](outstake/yield-tokenization/yt.md) have a "**perpetual lifecycle**" and are both standard **ERC20 tokens**. This design fundamentally solves the pain point of **liquidity fragmentation**, significantly enhancing composability and flexibility, enabling seamless integration into the broader DeFi ecosystem.
* [**Omnichain Universal Principal Token (UPT)**](outstake/yield-tokenization/upt.md)**:** **UPT** is an innovative, **omnichain universal principal token** backed by multiple yield-bearing tokens that share the same underlying asset. This design **allows liquidity to be shared across different yield-bearing tokens of the same underlying asset**. It's also a crucial component of the Outrun ecosystem â€“ an **omnichain stablecoin**. UPT aims to be a cornerstone in the DeFi space, demonstrating exceptional stability in cross-chain transfers and DeFi composability. This makes it an efficient, low-volatility medium for value transfer and settlement, significantly boosting the capital efficiency and composability of the entire Outrun ecosystem.
* [**Staked Position (SP)**](outstake/yield-tokenization/sp.md) **and** [**Point Yield Token (PYT)**](outstake/yield-tokenization/pyt.md)**:** **SP tokens** represent the right to redeem locked staked positions upon maturity and come with built-in **price discovery** and **fixed yield rate** mechanisms. **PYT**, on the other hand, focuses on capturing external protocol point yields, with the final interpretation rights belonging to the external protocols.

OutStake's design philosophy, particularly its emphasis on "**real yield**" and its avoidance of liquidity fragmentation and the impact of protocol incentive points, makes it more appealing to investors **seeking stable and sustainable returns** and to developers **pursuing composability**.
