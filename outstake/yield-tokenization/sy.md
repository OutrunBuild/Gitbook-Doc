# SY

SY is a vault token based on the [ERC5115](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5115) standard designed to encapsulate native yield tokens. It can wrap any native yield token and provides a standardized interface for interacting with the yield-generating mechanisms of any native yield token.

As all SYs have the same mechanism, Outstake interacts with SY as the main interface to all native yield tokens.OutStake automatically converts native yield tokens into SY and vice versa. This process happens automatically behind the scenes, making users feel as if theyâ€™re interacting directly with their native yield tokens instead of having to manually manage the conversion between SY and native yield tokens.
