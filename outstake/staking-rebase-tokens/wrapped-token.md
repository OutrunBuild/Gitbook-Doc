# Wrapped Token (WT)

**WT** is a stablecoin pegged to **Rebase native yield tokens**, obtainable through a 1:1 wrapping mechanism.

Thus, 1 **WT** always represents 1 **Rebase native yield token**, and the circulating supply of **WT** matches the amount of its corresponding **Rebase native yield tokens**. Users can convert **WT** back into **Rebase native yield tokens** at any time. Holding **WT** alone does not yield the staking rewards; it should be viewed as an analogous holding of **Rebase native yield tokens**.

In **Blast L2**, **orETH (WT)** will also serve as **Wrapped ETH** in Outswap.
