# Applicable Scenarios

For project teams, participating in FFLaunch not only provides a continuous revenue stream but also attracts a large number of users due to its low-risk nature, which can increase project exposure and offer ample liquidity for the token. FFLaunch is particularly suitable for the following scenarios:

1. **Verified Startup Teams:** Projects in the early stages of development with significant potential, especially those that have won awards in related startup competitions, can conduct a community seed round on FFLaunch. During this period, liquidity is locked until the TGE (Token Generation Event), allowing the project to iterate on the product and maintain engagement with the community.
2. **Mature Projects Preparing for TGE:** For projects that are already very mature and ready for TGE, where the project team and investment institutions have lock-up plans, FFLaunch can be used for public fundraising. Liquidity is locked until the team and institution tokens are unlocked, ensuring smooth project operation and increasing user retention during this period.
3. **Airdrop Preparation:** FFLaunch is also suitable for airdrop scenarios. Since FFLaunch supports custom token generators (subject to review), developers can authorize certain users on a whitelist to mint tokens through FFLaunch. Users can receive tokens for free, while liquidity is provided for the tokens. This approach keeps users engaged with the project even after the airdrop, unlike traditional airdrops where users often sell the tokens immediately and lose interest in the project.
