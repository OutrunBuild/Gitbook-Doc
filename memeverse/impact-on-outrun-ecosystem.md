# Impact of Memeverse on the Outrun Ecosystem

**Impact on TVL of the Outrun Ecosystem**

In this aspect, Memeverse has a similar impact on the Outrun ecosystem as **FFLaunch**, but to an even greater extent, due to the higher activity in **Memecoin** trading. With the permanent locking of a portion of liquidity, **the circulation of** [**PT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/pt.md) **will be significantly lower than the amount of staked native yield tokens**.

The rising demand for UPT and the high collateralization ratio will lead to an increase in its price, attracting more people to stake native yield tokens for arbitrage. The dual-growth flywheel composed of it and YT will result in a higher staking volume of native yield tokens and an increasing number of minted UPTs, thereby magnifying its network effect and making UPT a special **omnichain aggregated stablecoin** based on LSD and Restaking.

Memeverse enables the entire Outrun ecosystem to possess **extremely high capital efficiency**.

For example, stake 150 ETH to mint (nearly) **150 UETH**, and then by participating in the **Genesis** of Memeverse, the 150 UETH will be divided into two parts.

1. **100 UETH** will form trading pairs with newly minted Memecoins worth 100 UETH, thus minting liquidity proof tokens worth **200 UETH**.
2. **50 UETH** will form trading pairs with liquidity proof tokens worth 50 UETH, thereby creating liquidity worth **100 UETH**.

Finally, users will obtain liquidity proof tokens worth **150 UETH**. The whole process has created a Total Value Locked (TVL) and liquidity worth 600 ETH in total. Moreover, as transactions take place and the price of Memecoins goes up, the TVL will also increase accordingly.

If Memecoin holders continue to conduct **Memecoin Staking**, they will also mint native yield tokens of **Staked Memecoins**. Then, by restaking the native yield tokens of Memecoins on OutStake, they will also mint [**YT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/yt.md), [**PT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/pt.md), and [**POT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/pot.md) that are associated with Memecoins. All of these **newly added capitals** will bring **more potential income** to the Outrun ecosystem and its users, while also **enhancing the composability** of the Outrun ecosystem.

**The Combination of Memecoin and DeFi**

Memecoin can bring a large number of users to DeFi. Whether it's **the combination of Memeverse with OutSwap and OutStake**, or **the adoption and support of UPT (Liquid Staking Tokens) by Memeverse**, or **the design of Memecoin Staking in Memeverse**, as well as **the support for the Restaking of Memecoin's native yield tokens by OutStake**, Memeverse undoubtedly creates a new economy that perfectly combines Memecoin with DeFi. This is something that none of the previous DeFi protocols or Memecoin projects have achieved.

Traditional DeFi investors are deterred by the risks associated with Memecoins. However, through Memeverse, they can invest in Memecoins with extremely low and controllable risks. Meanwhile, many Memecoin players don't have a good understanding of DeFi either and simply trade Memecoins. By participating in Memeverse, they are passively involved in DeFi without having to bear much additional learning cost. In this way, DeFi users and Memecoin users can be converted into each other, opening up a stable two-way channel.

Overall, Memeverse, through its **innovative issuance model, staking yield mechanism, economic support measures, and community-driven force**, offers new perspectives and solutions for the development of Memecoins. These advantages not only help enhance Memecoins' market competitiveness but also promote the industry toward greater **transparency, security, and sustainability**.
