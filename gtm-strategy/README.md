# GTM Strategy (Pending)

**Phase 1: Internal Preparation and Infrastructure Construction (Pre-Launch / Foundation - 1-3 months before launch)**

* **Objectives:** product polishing, security audit, core information preparation, and basic community channel building.
* **Key actions**
  1. **Product Improvement and Testing**
     * **Internal Testing (Alpha Test):** The team and core related personnel repeatedly test the core functions of OutStake, OutSwap and Memeverse to ensure that the basic logic is correct.
     * **UI/UX optimization:** Ensure that the user interface is intuitive and easy to use, and lower the threshold for early users. Especially for complex concepts (such as PT, YT, UPT, SP), clear guidance and explanation are required.
     * **Documentation improvement:** Gitbook documentation needs to be more understandable, with more graphic explanations, how-to guides, and FAQs. Consider recording short instructional videos.
  2. **Security Audit**
     * **Hire a top auditing firm:** Contact at least 2-3 well-known smart contract auditing firms (such as CertiK, PeckShield, Trail of Bits, SlowMist, etc.) to conduct a comprehensive audit of the core contracts.
     * **Public audit report:** After the audit is completed, the report will be made public to demonstrate the project's security commitment. All high-risk and medium-risk vulnerabilities found will be fixed.
     * **Establish a Bug Bounty Program:** Before or in the early stages of the mainnet launch, launch a bug bounty program to attract white hat hackers to discover potential problems.
  3. **Core message and brand building**
     * **Distill the core narrative:** What is Outrun’s overall story? For example: “Through innovative yield tokenization and a fair launch model, it unlocks higher, more flexible, and more secure DeFi yields and participation opportunities for users.”
     * **Clarify the value proposition of each module**
       * OutStake: "A brand-new yield tokenization model that, compared to Pendle, offers higher returns and greater composability, introducing a stablecoin pegged to interest rates."
       * OutSwap: "A decentralized exchange integrating a composable native on-chain referral commission engine and a native anti-MEV module."
       * FFLaunch: "A revolutionary fair and risk-free token financing method where investors receive tokens for free while project teams secure continuous funding, achieving a win-win outcome."
       * Memeverse: "A disruptive innovation platform for Memecoin issuance, staking, and DAO governance, built around the 'sustainability' ethos and based on the FFLaunch philosophy."
     * **Design visual identity:** logo, brand colors, and unified visual style.
     * **Prepare basic content:** a long introduction to the project, a simplified introduction (Elevator Pitch), graphics and text highlighting core features, and an explanatory article/Twitter thread.
  4. **Community channel construction**
     * **Create core channels:** Twitter, Discord, Telegram (English main group + Chinese sub-group).
     * **Fill in basic information:** publish project profile, document link, and core advantages on various channels.
     * **Establish community rules:** clarify communication norms and create a positive and healthy discussion atmosphere.
  5. **Determine the initial launch chain and partners (preliminary)**
     * **Initial launch chain selection:** EVM chains with active users, prosperous ecosystem, potential and low cost are all potential initial launch choices.
     * **Initial outreach to potential partners:** Identify yield-based asset projects that may integrate OutStake (such as LSD providers), early-stage projects that may use FFLaunch, and trading aggregators that may be interested in OutSwap.

**Phase 2: Seed Users & Core Validation (1-2 months after launch)**

* **Goal:** Acquire the first batch (10-100) of high-quality seed users, verify the core functions and user experience of OutStake, OutSwap, and Memeverse, and collect real feedback.
* **Key actions**
  1. **Invitation-only Closed Beta**
     * **Target:** Targeted invitations to experienced DeFi users, yield farmers, early contributors to other protocols, trusted KOLs or researchers. Invitations can be made through Twitter DM, recommendations from acquaintances, small-scale cooperation groups, etc.
     * **Content:** Focus on testing OutStake's staking, minting PT(UPT)/YT/SP, and redemption process; OutSwap's trading, adding/removing liquidity, MEV Guard, and referral rebate engine; Memeverse's Memecoin full-chain launch and creation, Staking mechanism, and Memecoin DAO governance
     * **Incentives:** Provide clear incentives, such as:
       * **Early Contributor Status/NFT:** Grants special status in Discord, and may have airdrops or other benefits in the future.
       * **Potential airdrop weight:** implying or explicitly participating in the test will gain weight in future token airdrops, which may be issued in the form of FAirdrop (FFLaunch) participation quotas.
       * **Direct rewards:** Users who discover major bugs or make high-quality suggestions will be rewarded with a small amount of stablecoin or ETH.
     * **Feedback collection:** Set up a dedicated #beta-feedback channel in Discord, where team members actively respond and interact. Regularly organize small-scale voice AMAs to answer questions.
  2. **Content preheating and education**
     * **In-depth analysis articles/threads:** Start publishing in-depth articles on Twitter, Mirror, or project blogs, explaining in detail the YT revenue token model of OutStake, the design of UPT, the referral rebate engine and MEV Guard principle of OutSwap, the absolute Fair & Free feature of FFLaunch, and the Staking and DAO governance mechanism of Memeverse. Focus on one point each time and explain it in depth.
     * **Comparative analysis:** Publish a comparative analysis with competitors (such as Pendle, Pump.fun) to highlight Outrun’s advantages. Be objective and fair, and use data and logic to speak.
     * **AMA (Ask Me Anything):** Cooperate with some small but professional DeFi communities or KOLs to conduct AMA, with team founders/core members personally participating to answer early questions and build trust.
  3. **Small-scale cooperation starts**
     * **Integration testing:** Cooperate with 2-3 revenue-generating asset projects to incorporate their assets into OutStake for small-scale testing.
     * **Collaborate with 1-2 small projects:** If there is a suitable project, or Outrun itself, we can try to conduct a proof of concept of FFLaunch on a small scale (possibly on a testnet or a small-scale mainnet).
     * **Collaborate with Public Good Communities:** If there is a suitable Public Good community (such as OpenBuild, DengLian Community), we can try to conduct a proof-of-concept of Memeverse on a small scale, support the Public Good community by launching Memecoin, and build a sustainable Memecoin ecosystem (possibly on a testnet or a small-scale mainnet).

**Phase 3: Early Adopter Growth & Community Building (2-3 months after launch)**

* **Goal:** Conduct public beta, expand the user base to hundreds to thousands of people, build an active core community, verify the appeal of FFLaunch and Memeverse, and begin to accumulate OutStake and OutSwap liquidity.
* **Key actions**
  1. **Incentivized Beta/Mainnet**
     * **OutStake Early Staking Incentive:** Provide additional points incentive rewards to users who stake in OutStake early.
     * **OutSwap early LP incentives:** provide rewards to users who provide liquidity for core trading pairs (such as UUSD/USDC, ETH/UETH, PT/YT) on OutSwap.
     * **Memeverse early creation and transaction volume incentives:** Incentives are provided based on the funds locked by users participating in the creation of Memeverse and the transaction volume of Memecoin.
  2. **Ambassador Program**
     * **Recruitment and empowerment:** Recruit ambassadors from early active and outstanding community members. Provide resources (such as content materials, internal information), guidance and rewards (tokens, stablecoins, peripherals).
     * **Tasks:** content creation (tutorials, analysis, memes), community management (answering questions, organizing events), multilingual translation, external promotion.
  3. **KOL Marketing (Medium Scale)**
     * **Partners:** Choose to cooperate with influential KOLs in the fields of revenue strategy, L2 ecology, Launchpad or Memecoin.
     * **Forms of cooperation:** review videos/articles, Twitter Space AMA, co-hosting trading/staking competitions, trying out FFLaunch or Memeverse to launch a small fun project.
  4. **FFLaunch's first official project launch**
     * **Select projects:** Choose 1-2 projects with potential, reliable teams, and consistent with Outrun's philosophy for the first FFLaunch. Be sure to do due diligence.
     * **Joint promotion:** jointly conduct market preheating and promotion with the project party, emphasizing the "zero risk" advantage of FFLaunch.
     * **Effect review:** After the first FFLaunch, timely collect feedback from investors and project parties, summarize experience, and optimize the process.
  5. **Memeverse warm-up and concept introduction**
     * **Release introduction content:** Start to introduce the concept and advantages of Memeverse (fairness, security, benefits, DAO) in detail.
     * **Community Discussion:** Lead community discussions on views and expectations about the Memeverse.
     * **Possible small internal meme launch:** The team could launch an Outrun-related meme coin on the Memeverse (possibly on a testnet first) as a demonstration and test, either by itself or in collaboration with core community members.
  6. **Basic data dashboard:** Develop and launch a basic data dashboard to display key indicators such as OutStake’s TVL, YT price, OutSwap’s trading volume/liquidity, FFLaunch and Memeverse project status, to increase transparency.
