# Growth Flywheel

**Outrun** has built a unique, multi-module closed-loop ecosystem that addresses pain points in various scenarios through modular design. Each module serves a specific function, yet achieves interoperability through data and resource sharing, creating a **synergistic effect** that drives the continuous operation of the **growth flywheel**. This design significantly enhances the ecosystem's **network effects** and **capital efficiency**.

First, take a look at the **module architecture diagram** of the Outrun ecosystem:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **OutStake** is the **yield tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure** of the Outrun ecosystem, serving as the foundational module. UPT, as the **lifeblood** of the Outrun ecosystem, flows through all modules, connecting the entire system.
* **OutSwap** is the **liquidity hub** of the Outrun ecosystem, providing efficient liquidity support for assets issued by OutStake, FFLaunch, and Memeverse, acting as the **heart** of the ecosystem.
* **FFLaunch** and **Memeverse** are the **traffic entry points** and **asset issuance platforms** of the Outrun ecosystem, located at the top layer, are the areas with the highest user activity, and serve as **powerful engines** driving the growth flywheel.

Next, we will deeply analyze how Outrun achieves synergistic effects through its unique multi-module closed-loop ecosystem.

### **Enhancement of OutStake by FFLaunch (Memeverse)**&#xD;

When users **participate in genesis** or **trade tokens** in the **FFLaunch** or **Memeverse** modules, the system automatically converts underlying assets (such as USDT, USDC, ETH, BNB, etc.) into corresponding UPT stablecoins (such as UUSD, UETH, UBNB, etc.) at a 1:1 exchange rate through [**Wrap Stake**](outstake/yield-tokenization/upt.md#wrap-stake).

After the genesis stage, liquidity pools deployed on **OutSwap** adopt the form of **project token (Memecoin) / UPT** trading pairs. When trading tokens with underlying assets, the system automatically compares the exchange rates of OutSwap and Wrap Stake, selecting the optimal path.

By depositing underlying assets into the OutStake module via Wrap Stake, only UPT is minted, without minting YT tokens. This means that the interest generated by the underlying assets in the integrated yield-bearing asset protocol is **distributed to other YT token holders**, thereby increasing the [**Implied Real APY**](outstake/glossary/implied-real-apy.md) of the corresponding market.

For example:

1. Assume the current APY of sUSDS is _**10%**_, with an exchange rate of sUSDS to USDC at _**1:1**_ (for simplicity, the exchange rate does not affect the final calculation), and no one has participated in staking in the sUSDS Market on OutStake, resulting in a TVL of _**0**_.
2. At this point, users in Memeverse participate in the genesis phase, depositing a total of _**1,000,000 USDC**_, which is converted into _**1,000,000 UUSD**_ through the **Wrap Stake** feature of the OutStake module.
3. Based on the [**calculation method**](outstake/glossary/implied-real-apy.md) for Implied Real APY, the current Implied Real APY for the sUSDS Market is _**3,650,000,000%**_, an undeniably attractive figure that immediately draws other users to **Stake(Not Wrap Stake)** in OutStake.
4.  We further calculate that when the **Wrap Stake TVL** is fixed at _**1,000,000 sUSDS**_, the Implied Real APY varies based on the amount of assets **Staked(Not Wrap Stake)** in the sUSDS Market, as shown in the table below:

    <table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="219.2855224609375" align="center">Stake TVL (1 Year Lock-in )</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Implied Real APY</th><th align="center" valign="top">Boost rate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">0 <strong>sUSDS</strong></td><td align="center" valign="middle"><em><strong>3,650,000,000%</strong></em></td><td align="center" valign="top"><em><strong>3,650,000,00%</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><em>1,000,000</em> <strong>sUSDS</strong></td><td align="center" valign="middle"><em><strong>20%</strong></em></td><td align="center" valign="top"><strong>100%</strong></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><em>2,000,000</em> <strong>sUSDS</strong></td><td align="center" valign="middle"><strong>15%</strong></td><td align="center" valign="top"><strong>50%</strong></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><em>3,000,000</em> <strong>sUSDS</strong></td><td align="center" valign="middle"><strong>13.33%</strong></td><td align="center" valign="top"><strong>33.33%</strong></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><em>4,000,000</em> <strong>sUSDS</strong></td><td align="center" valign="middle"><strong>12.5%</strong></td><td align="center" valign="top"><strong>25%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

From the table above, we can roughly predict that every **1 unit of Wrap Stake TVL** can attract an additional **3â€“4 units of Stake TVL**, and more TVL will lead to the minting of more **UPT** stablecoins, bringing greater liquidity to the Outrun ecosystem.

The Outrun ecosystem, through its two traffic entry points, Memeverse and FFLaunch, can naturally drive the growth of the OutStake and OutSwap modules. Therefore, our early growth focus is on the Memeverse and FFLaunch modules.
