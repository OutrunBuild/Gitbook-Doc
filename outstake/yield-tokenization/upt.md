# UPT

UPT is a staked principal token minted by staking SY, designed to unlock the liquidity of staked tokens. When users stake SY, they must specify a lock-up period to mint UPT, YT, and POT. The amount of UPT is not minted on a 1:1 basis with the staked SY but is instead related to the staking duration (the amount of YT minted) and the **exchange rate** of the Native Yield Token to the Native Asset Token. Simply put, the amount of the Native Yield Token is first converted to the equivalent value of the Native Asset Token, and then the following algorithm is applied to calculate it:

**YT Redeemable Value:** The native yield that can be redeemed by burning one **YT**.

Therefore, the value of UPT is theoretically linked to the value of the Native Asset Token, and its total supply will always be less than the amount of Native Asset Tokens that can be exchanged for the staked Native Yield Tokens, ensuring that the value of UPT does not significantly decouple from the value of the Native Asset Token.

Over time, as the yield pool continuously accumulates native yield, the redeemable value of YT increases. The amount of UPT minted from newly staked SY will slightly decrease, but regardless of the number of UPT minted, users will be able to burn the UPT minted at that time to fully redeem their staked SY upon the lock-up period's expiration.

In general, Native Yield Tokens can be roughly classified as follows:

1. Rebase Tokens - Tokens that increase their balance over time.

_Examples: stETH, aUSDC_

2. Reward-bearing Non-Rebase Tokens - Tokens that appreciate in value over time.

_Examples: wstETH, Stone, slisBNB_

**It is important to note**: For reward-bearing non-rebase Native Yield Tokens, the quantity of staked Native Yield Tokens in the position does not change after the lock-up period expires. However, their value (relative to the Native Asset Token's exchange ratio) will increase with the accumulation of native yield. Thus, burning UPT does not redeem the same quantity of non-rebase Native Yield Tokens as initially staked; instead, it will be slightly less because part of the value is attributed to YT.

### **Universal Asset Principal Token**

OutStakeâ€™s UPT is a universal asset principal token. Staking Native Yield Tokens of the same asset type mints the same universal asset principal token. Simply put, staking stETH, rETH, or Stone will mint the same UPT token, rather than different UPT tokens. This design allows Native Yield Tokens of the same category to share UPT liquidity and enhances their composability.

For example, with ETH, there are currently many LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) related to ETH in the market. The liquidity of these tokens is fragmented, with some having ample liquidity and others having less. The liquidity of an LST is often related to its adoption in DeFi programs, such as the depth of liquidity pools like LST/ETH or LST/USDT. The liquidity accumulation process for each LST can be challenging.

Introducing a universal asset principal token (UETH) can reduce these redundant processes. Suppose there is a liquidity-scarce LST called xETH. The market would only need liquidity pools such as UETH/ETH and UETH/USDT. By staking xETH through Outstake to mint UETH, it can connect to the existing liquidity in the market. As more market-validated LSTs are added, liquidity will become increasingly ample.

### Omnichain Standard

UPT will be built using LayerZero's OFT standard, making it an omnichain token that can be seamlessly transferred to any blockchain, thereby amplifying its network effects.
