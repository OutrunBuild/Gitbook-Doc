#### As an Investor Participating in FFLaunch

* **Obtaining Tokens for Free:** After the liquidity lock-up period expires, investors can redeem the liquidity they added before. This is basically equivalent to obtaining tokens for free. Even if the project fails, investors can still retrieve most of their initial investments, thus obtaining ultra-low-risk returns.
* **Avoiding Pump and Dump by Insiders:** When the tokens are listed, all the tokens are in the liquidity pool and no one has obtained tokens in advance. Moreover, during the liquidity lock-up period, new tokens cannot be minted or released, preventing the project team from using the initial users as the liquidity for their exit.
* **Rug Pull Prevention:** The FFLaunch model prevents project teams from absconding with raised funds, ensuring fairer token distribution and protecting investors' rights.
* **Proof of liquidity Token:** When investors lock liquidity, they mint [**POL**](../proof-of-liquidity-token/) tokens. Through POL tokens, investors can release their locked liquidity at any time or participate in other DeFi activities, thereby managing risk exposure.
