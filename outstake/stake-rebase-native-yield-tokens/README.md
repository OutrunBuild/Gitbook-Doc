# Stake Rebase Native Yield Tokens

**Rebase native yield tokens** refer to native yield tokens that require manual claim of the yield or automatically rebase, such as **Blast ETH** and **Lido stETH**.

When staking **Rebase native yield tokens**, the Outrun ecosystem mints three types of ERC20 tokens:

* **Wrapped Token (WT):** A wrapper token for the **Rebase native yield tokens**.
* **Principal Token (PT):** Can be burned upon maturity to redeem the full amount of staked WT.
* **Yield Token (YT):** Pegged to the native yield rate of the native yield token and can be redeemed at any time.
