# Impact on Outrun Ecosystem

### Increasing Outstake's TVL

Users participating in FFLaunch will stake their **Native Yield Tokens** in the Outstake protocol. These staked assets will form liquidity pools (LPs) along with reserved tokens and will be locked for the same duration as the Outstake.

* Users will receive corresponding [**YT**](https://outrun.gitbook.io/doc/outstake/yield-tokenization/yt) after staking Native Yield Tokens.
* The total locked value (TVL) of Outstake will significantly increase due to the increase in staked assets.

### Boosting Demand for LSTs

When participating in FFLaunch, the Outstake protocol will mint [PT](https://outrun.gitbook.io/doc/outstake/yield-tokenization/pt), which will be locked in **Outrun AMM**. Users will need to use PTs when purchasing tokens.

* This will directly increase the demand for PT in the market.
* Users may stake more Native Yield Tokens to mint PT, or directly purchase these tokens from Outswap.
* Consequently, the TVL and trading volume of Outswap will increase.

### Cultivating User Usage Habits

During the prolonged period of locked liquidity, users will gradually become accustomed to trading with PTs.

* Long-term usage habits will help users accept and become accustomed to using these tokens, PTs will serve as the base tokens for trading pairs.
* With the addition of more trading pairs, an increasing number of users will use PTs, further driving the prosperity of the Outrun ecosystem.

### Breaking the Limitations of LSTs Usage Scenarios

Many Liquidity Staking Tokens (LSTs) face limitations in their usage scenarios, but FFLaunch provides an innovative way to overcome these limitations

* By creating new usage scenarios on Outstake and Outswap, FFLaunch enhances the practicality of LSTs.
* This strategy will attract more users, thereby increasing the activity and value of the entire ecosystem.

### Summary

FFLaunch increases Outstake's TVL by staking Native Yield Tokens, boosting the market demand for PT, and fostering user trading habits through long-term locked LPs. These measures will promote the prosperity of the Outrun ecosystem and break the current limitations of LST use cases, offering users more diverse and attractive options.
