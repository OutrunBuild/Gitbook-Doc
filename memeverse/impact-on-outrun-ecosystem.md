# Impact of Memeverse on the Outrun Ecosystem

**Impact on TVL of the Outrun Ecosystem**

In this aspect, Memeverse has a similar impact on the Outrun ecosystem as **FFLaunch**, but to an even greater extent, due to the higher activity in **Memecoin** trading. With the permanent locking of a portion of liquidity, **the circulation of** [**PT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/upt.md) **will be significantly lower than the amount of staked yield-bearing tokens**.

The rising demand for UPT and the high collateralization ratio will lead to an increase in its price, attracting more people to stake yield-bearing tokens for arbitrage. The dual-growth flywheel composed of it and YT will result in a higher staking volume of yield-bearing tokens and an increasing number of minted UPTs, thereby magnifying its network effect and making UPT a special **omnichain aggregated stablecoin** based on LSD and Restaking.

If Memecoin holders continue to conduct **Memecoin Staking**, they will also mint yield-bearing tokens of **Staked Memecoins**. Then, by restaking the yield-bearing tokens of Memecoins on OutStake, they will also mint [**YT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/yt.md) and [**PT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/upt.md) that are associated with Memecoins. All of these **newly added capitals** will bring **more potential income** to the Outrun ecosystem and its users, while also **enhancing the composability** of the Outrun ecosystem.

**The Combination of Memecoin and DeFi**

Memecoin can bring a large number of users to DeFi. Whether it's **the combination of Memeverse with OutSwap and OutStake**, or **the adoption and support of UPT (Liquid Staking Tokens) by Memeverse**, or **the design of Memecoin Staking in Memeverse**, as well as **the support for the Restaking of Memecoin's yield-bearing tokens by OutStake**, Memeverse undoubtedly creates a new economy that perfectly combines Memecoin with DeFi. This is something that none of the previous DeFi protocols or Memecoin projects have achieved.

Traditional DeFi investors are deterred by the risks associated with Memecoins. However, through Memeverse, they can invest in Memecoins with **extremely low and controllable risks**. Meanwhile, many Memecoin players don't have a good understanding of DeFi either and simply trade Memecoins. By participating in Memeverse, they are passively involved in DeFi without having to bear much additional learning cost. In this way, DeFi users and Memecoin users can be **converted into each other**, opening up a **stable two-way channel**.

Overall, Memeverse, through its **innovative issuance model, staking yield mechanism, economic support measures, and community-driven force**, offers new perspectives and solutions for the development of Memecoins. These advantages not only help enhance Memecoins' market competitiveness but also promote the industry toward greater **transparency, security, and sustainability**.
