# Referral service

The value of Memecoins often comes from community members spreading the word and actively promoting them. When community members discuss and share their views and experiences with Memecoins on different platforms, it effectively spreads the value and philosophy of the coin, attracting more new users and investors.

The success of Memecoins like Dogecoin largely depends on the power of the community. Through platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and other social media, community members continuously promote, share memes, organize events, and attract a large number of supporters, including celebrities. Eventually, Dogecoin not only became a popular cryptocurrency but was also adopted in specific practical scenarios such as tipping, donations, and sponsorships.

Therefore, we have developed a unique referral service where users can generate **exclusive referral links** to share on social media platforms. Through these referral links, other users can **directly access** the Memecoin details page with a single click, eliminating the steps of searching for contract addresses and checking details within the community. When transactions are made on the Memecoin details page, referrers will receive a **20%** **commission** from the protocol fees. This referral service not only stimulates community activity but also reduces barriers for potential community members to join, bringing the following benefits to Memeverse:

* **Simplified Referral Process:** With one-click access links, potential users can quickly learn about and trade Memecoin, reducing the cumbersome steps of finding contract addresses and checking Memecoin details, greatly lowering the entry threshold.
* **Incentive Mechanism:** Referrers receive a **20%** **commission** from the protocol fees. This reward mechanism not only encourages existing community members to actively promote but also attracts new members, expanding the community.
* **Increased Transparency and Trust:** Referral links directly lead to the Memecoin details page, allowing users to quickly obtain the necessary information, enhancing the project's transparency and user trust.
* **Enhanced Community Activity:** This Referral method can motivate community members to participate and interact more frequently, enhancing community activity and cohesion.

**When users trade using your Memeverse referral link, it will temporarily bypass Outrun AMM's referrers. If the trading user does not have a referrerat that time, you will be directly registered as the user's referrer.**
