# Yield-Bearing Token

Yield-Bearing Tokens are a special type of cryptocurrency token that allows holders to earn passive yields by holding them. Examples include **wstETH**, **slisBNB**, **sUSDe**, **RWA**, **LP liquidity tokens**, and more.

These tokens typically generate yields through specific mechanisms such as **staking**, **lending**, or **yield farming**. They are very common in the DeFi space, designed to provide investors with a way to both hold assets and earn yields.
