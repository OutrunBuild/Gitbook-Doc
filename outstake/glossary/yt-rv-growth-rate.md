# YT RV Growth Rate

The YT redeemable value growth rate measures **the daily percentage change in the redeemable value of YT**. In short, it reflects the rate at which the actual yields each YT can claim from the Yield Pool increase or decrease daily.

This growth rate is primarily influenced by the following factors:

1. **Growth of Accumulated Yields** (Positive Impact): The more yield-bearing assets are staked in the staking pool, the faster the accumulated yields grow. This is the **core driver of the continuous increase in YT's redeemable value**.
2. **Changes in YT Total Supply**:
   * **Increase** (Dilution, Negative Impact): When new yield-bearing assets are staked, new YT tokens are minted. Even if the total accumulated yields in the Yield Pool remain unchanged, **the increased number of YT tokens dilutes the yields** **share per YT,** leading to an instantaneous decrease in its redeemable value.
   * **Decrease** (Appreciation, Supportive): **Burning YT tokens does not directly affect YT's redeemable value**, but it reduces the total supply of YT. This means that, for the remaining YT tokens, the share of future yields each token can claim will relatively increase, thereby supporting an increase in its redeemable value.

The YT redeemable value growth rate is a key indicator of YT's actual performance, as it directly reflects the real change in the value of the yields rights represented by each YT, making it critical for evaluating YT investment performance.
