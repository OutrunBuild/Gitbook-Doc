# OutStake

**OutStake** is a protocol entirely built around **yield-bearing tokens**, introducing the first **non-USD stablecoin model** tied to **yields rates**. Compared to other yield token protocols in the market, such as **Pendle**, OutStake offers **greater flexibility, enhanced composability**, and provides **higher returns along with multiple sources of income**. The assets supported by OutStake form the foundational support for the Outrun ecosystem, providing a stable base for the entire system. Specifically, OutStake operates as follows:

1. **A novel staking model based on interest-bearing tokens**: Through OutStake, it controls the interest generated by its interest-bearing tokens and unlocks the liquidity of its staked assets, allowing them to be used in a range of DeFi applications. It adopts a completely new design different from the market, enabling users to mint PT/YT tokens with an **eternal lifecycle**, which offers stronger **composability and flexibility**.
2. **Interest-Rate-Linked Stablecoin (YT)**: The value of an interest-rate-linked stablecoin is directly tied to interest rates. The economic model built around it provides stakers with higher income and a variety of revenue sources. It is highly composable, allowing developers to create new products around it, thereby enriching the Outrun ecosystem.
3. **Omnichain Universal Principal Token (UPT)**: UPT is a omni-chain universal principal token supported by **LayerZero**, enabling seamless transfer across different blockchains to amplify its network effects. It allows the conversion of principal tokens (PTs) of the **same underlying asset type** into UPT (for example, converting PT-Stone, PT-wstETH, and PT-rETH into UETH). This enables liquidity sharing among different yield-bearing tokens of the same underlying asset type, thereby enhancing the composability of UPT and strengthening the liquidity of similar yield-bearing tokens.
4. **Position Option Tokens(POT):** These option tokens represent the right to redeem the **yield-bearing token** at the end of its lock-up period. This option allows users to trade for a fixed interest rate without trading the **UPT** itself, thereby enhancing capital efficiency.
