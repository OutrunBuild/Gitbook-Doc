# DeSocial (Future)

In the **Web1** era, users were primarily consumers of content rather than creators. Control over content and data was concentrated in the hands of a few platforms, and the economic benefits generated belonged entirely to these platforms. With the advent of the **Web2** era, users not only consumed content but also became creators. Nonetheless, large platforms continued to hold the reins of data and content, with economic benefits distributed between the platforms and some creators.

However, we are now moving towards the **Web3** era, whose core belief is to achieve decentralization through blockchain technology, empowering users with more control over their own data and identity, and ensuring that the value created by user-generated content is fairly distributed to every participant in the community. Among existing Dapps, we have yet to find one that truly embodies our vision for Web3. If only a select few continue to benefit, how does this differ from Web2?

**DeSocial** is the new frontier that Outrun is set to explore. After gaining a deep understanding of **OutStake**, **OutSwap**, **FFLaunch**, and **Memeverse**, if you possess keen insight, you will discover that the products and economic models of the Outrun ecosystem have tremendous potential for expansion. Our next goal is to redefine DeSocial by introducing **a new mechanism for benefit distribution, a sustainable economic model, and a unique user interaction experience**.

Based on the sustainable economic models of **Creator Token**, **Creator Token Vault**, and **FFLaunch**, we plan to expand the Outrun ecosystem into various social domains, including microblogging, short videos, live streaming, communities, and membership subscription platforms. By sharing benefits among consumers, creators, and platforms, we aim to achieve a **win-win situation**.
