# Staking Non-Rebase Native Yield Tokens

**Non-Rebase native yield tokens** have their native yield built into the tokens themselves. Burning **Non-Rebase native yield tokens** allows for the redemption of both the principal and the native yield. Examples include **slisBNB (Lista)** and **STONE (Stakestone).**

For staking **Non-Rebase native yield tokens**, the Outrun ecosystem mints two types of ERC20 tokens:

* **Principal Token (PT):** Upon maturity, PT can be burned to redeem the principal portion of the staked **Non-Rebase native yield tokens**.
* **Yield Token (YT):** Pegged to the native yield rate of the native yield token and can be redeemed at any time.
