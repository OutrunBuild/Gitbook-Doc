# Impact on Outrun Ecosystem

### Increasing Outstake's TVL

Users participating in FFLaunch will stake their **Native Yield Tokens** in the Outstake protocol. These staked assets will form liquidity pools (LPs) along with reserved tokens and will be locked for the same duration as the Outstake.

* Users will receive corresponding **YieldToken(YT)** after staking **Native Yield Tokens**.
* The total locked value (TVL) of Outstake will significantly increase due to the increase in staked assets.

### Boosting Demand for LSTs

When participating in FFLaunch, the Outstake protocol will mint LSTs, which will be locked in Outrun AMM. Users will need to use LSTs when purchasing tokens.

* This will directly increase the demand for LSTs in the market.
* Users may stake more **Native Yield Tokens** to mint LSTs, or directly purchase these tokens from Outswap.
* Consequently, the TVL and trading volume of Outswap will increase.

### Cultivating User Usage Habits

During the prolonged period of locked liquidity, users will gradually become accustomed to trading with LSTs.

* Long-term usage habits will help users accept and become accustomed to using these tokens, LSTs will serve as the base tokens for trading pairs.
* With the addition of more trading pairs, an increasing number of users will use LSTs, further driving the prosperity of the Outrun ecosystem.

### Breaking the Limitations of LSTs Usage Scenarios

Many Liquidity Staking Tokens (LSTs) face limitations in their usage scenarios, but FFLaunch provides an innovative way to overcome these limitations

* By creating new usage scenarios on Outstake and Outswap, FFLaunch enhances the practicality of LSTs.
* This strategy will attract more users, thereby increasing the activity and value of the entire ecosystem.
