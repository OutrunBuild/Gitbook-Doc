# YT

YT represents the right to the yield of staked yield-bearing tokens, obtained by staking yield-bearing tokens and specifying a lock-up period. YT separates the yields from the yield-bearing tokens, allowing it to be traded on secondary markets and used to build other DeFi Lego components.

### **A true universal fungible YieldToken**

Unlike YieldTokens from other protocols in the market, which are either NFTs or special FTs (e.g., Pendle), **these are non-fungible**. This characteristic leads to a **lack of liquidity** for YieldTokens and **reduces the composability** of the protocol.

OutStake's YT is a **genuinely fungible token** **(FT),** offering **excellent liquidity and strong composability**. For every 1 yield-bearing token staked for 1 day, 1 YT is minted. If **ùë•** yield-bearing tokens is staked for **ùë¶** days, **ùë•ùë¶** YT will be minted. Therefore, theoretically, 1 YT is anchored to the yields generated by staking 1 yield-bearing token for 1 day.

YT can be freely traded and can be redeemed at any time to claim the accumulated yields in the yield pool. When burning YT, the redemption of yields is proportional to the amount of YT burned relative to the total YT supply.

### **The Stability Mechanism of YT**

YT is also a **non-USD algorithmic stablecoin** pegged to the **yields rate**. Theoretically, one YT represents the yields produced by one yield-bearing token over one day. Since YT is linked to the yields rate and minted through the staking of yield-bearing tokens, it differs from early algorithmic stablecoins like Luna. The value system of YT is a closed system, ensuring that **a price death spiral will never occur**.

Initially, the redeemable value of YT (the yields that can be redeemed by destroying YT ) will gradually increase over time from the point when the first YT is minted, theoretically ceasing to grow once it reaches its theoretical value cap. Burning YT will redeem yields proportionally, so it does not affect its redeemable value. **The redeemable value of YT will only decrease when new YT is minted**, and the decrease will be reaccumulated in the future (due to the staking of new yield-bearing tokens).

However, in practice, some users may burn YT before the lock-up period of their staked yield-bearing token expires, leading to a reduction in YT‚Äôs circulation while yields continues to accumulate in the yield pool. This can eventually cause YT‚Äôs **redeemable value to exceed its theoretical value cap**, resulting in two possible outcomes:

1. In the future, burning YT will allow for the redemption of more yield, **increasing the returns for long-term stakers**.
2. Users can stake more Yield-bearing Tokens to mint new YT and immediately burn it to redeem yields for arbitrage. However, this will provide more fuel for the next value breakthrough. Additionally, the number of PT minted from new staking will slightly decrease, **leading to a higher implied fixed interest rate for the minted POT**.

### **Broader prospects**

YT is not only a tool for helping long-term stakers earn more yield but also a truly fungible, universal yield token. Additionally, it represents **Web3's first decentralized algorithmic stablecoin anchored to yield rate(inflation rate)**. In the competitive market, YT remains connected to these yield rates. Looking ahead, Outrun will utilize YT‚Äôs unique features and community to develop even more innovative products.

### **The mathematical model of YT**

While YT may appear simple on the surface, the ability for YT to be freely traded and for any YT holder to redeem yields at any time introduces a highly complex game-theoretic process and mathematical model.

The following, we construct a **minimal model** to calculate impermanent profit and losses.

Assuming that the accumulated yields in the YieldPool is 0, and 1 YT is pegged to the yield produced by 1 yield-bearing token over 1 day, which we denote as **ùë¶**.

User A stakes **ùëé** yield-bearing tokens and locks them for **ùëö** days, which will mint **ùëéùëö** YTs. We will consider other users as a collective entity, referred to as User B, who stakes **ùëè** yield-bearing tokens and locks them for **ùëõ** days, which will mint **ùëèùëõ** YTs.

After **ùë°** days:

The **Impermanent Profit and Loss Ratio (**_**IPnLR**_**)** can be obtained by dividing the actual earnings by the expected earnings and then subtracting 1.\
\&#xNAN;_**IPnLR = (Actual Earnings / Expected Earnings) - 1**_

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/1709647700208.jpg" alt="" width="342"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The **impermanent profit and loss (**_**IPnL**_**)** can be obtained by multiplying each user's **impermanent profit and loss ratio (**_**IPnLR**_**)** by their respective expected earnings.\
\&#xNAN;_**IPnLa = IPnLRa \* Expected Profit\_A**_\
\&#xNAN;_**IPnLb = IPnLRb \* Expected Profit\_B**_

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/1709648075123.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the above figure, we can deduce that there is an impermanent profit and loss conservation between User _A_ and User _B_. If User _A_ and User _B_ lock up their assets for the same duration, both parties would experience no impermanent profit or loss. In other words, an individual user's impermanent profit and loss are correlated with the weighted average duration of other users in the staking pool.

Of course, the above is just a minimal model. The actual situation will be more complex due to the influence of multiple players in the game. Therefore, we will set a maximum lock-up time limit -- _**MaxLockInterval**_. The closer the user's lock-up time is to _**MaxLockInterval**_, the smaller the _**IL**_ and the larger the _**IP**_. Additionally, users can reduce _**IL**_ and obtain more _**IP**_ by redeeming their principal immediately upon the expiration of the lock-up period and then staking to mint REY again. When the user's lock-up time is _**MaxLockInterval**_, there will definitely be no _**IL**_.

Based on the model presented above, Outrun can help long-term stakers earn more income. We believe that ETH staking itself aims to make Ethereum more decentralized and secure. Therefore, users who contribute to the long-term protection of Ethereum should be rewarded more generously.
