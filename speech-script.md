Hello everyone, I'm Jason, the founder of Outrun.

Outrun is a multi-module, closed-loop Super App ecosystem. It includes Yield Tokenization × Stablecoin × Memecoin × DAO.

The first module, OutStake, is a yield tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure built around interest-bearing assets.

OK, let's take a look at the market size. In TradFi, the total value of global interest-bearing assets is 300 trillion dollars, and interest rate derivatives are worth 500 trillion dollars. But on-chain interest-bearing assets are only 150 billion dollars, and interest rate derivatives are just 12 billion dollars. This market still has tons of growth potential.

As the US dollar cuts rates, leading to declining interest rates, many traditional leveraged strategies will become unfeasible, while capital still needs to seek higher-yield opportunities. Meanwhile, existing on-chain yield tokenization models only cover interest-bearing assets with airdrop points, ignoring those without, thereby creating a structural gap.

Our solution is to capture native yields from liquidity in the Outrun ecosystem, providing additional rewards to stakers. Through the Outrun ecosystem's native UPT stablecoin, we offer leveraged yield opportunities without borrowing or liquidation risks. For interest-bearing assets without airdrop points, incentivizing UPT stablecoin liquidity attracts leveraged staking, killing two birds with one stone and creating a growth flywheel.

OutStake splits interest-bearing tokens into SP and YT. SP can be further split into UPT stablecoin, releasing principal liquidity while retaining fixed yields.

OutStake allows users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as earning fixed yields, locking in current rates, leveraging long on yields, gain more yield through DeFi combinations, and more.

This is our roadmap: We will launch the public testnet in Q4, the mainnet in Q1 next year, and TGE in Q4 next year.

Our team members come from JD.com, Tencent, and Crypto.com, with extensive experience in both Web2 and Web3 industries, as well as rich on-chain experience. We have conducted in-depth research on DeFi and Memecoins. Meanwhile, Outrun has iterated through multiple versions, winning awards at ETH Shenzhen and BNB Hack respectively.

This is the complete Outrun ecosystem, composed of multiple interconnected modules. If you're curious about how we integrate Memecoin, Low Risk DeFi, and DAO. Even the most conservative investors can benefit from the development of the Memecoin ecosystem. After the Demo, we can dive deeper into this.

Finally, here are some of our additional information.
