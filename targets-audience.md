# Targets Audience

Outrun's success lies in its precise market positioning and exceptional user appeal. Through innovative product design, it builds deep trust and stickiness with users.

**Outrun's Target User Groups and Characteristics:**

Outrun's product matrix caters to several key groups within the Web3 ecosystem, each with unique characteristics, behaviors, and preferences:

1. **Yield-Bearing Token Holders & Yield Strategists (OutStake):**
   * **Characteristics:** Hold various yield-bearing tokens (LSTs, yield-bearing stablecoins, RWAs, etc.), aiming to enhance capital efficiency and pursue higher or more flexible yields. Interested in market liquidity, fixed income, and yield trading.
   * **Behavioral Preferences:** Seeking a yield tokenization model with **higher capital efficiency**, enhancing the returns of yield-bearing assets, and combining new DeFi strategies, engage in yield speculation or hedging, and explore fixed-income opportunities offered by different staked positions (SP).&#x20;
   * **Outrun's Appeal:** Offers UPT /YT tokens with perpetual lifecycles, enhancing the composability of yield tokens; UPT unifies on-chain liquidity and stablecoin functionality, solving the problem of liquidity fragmentation, allowing the cost-free release of liquidity while retaining the interest of yield-bearing assets, greatly improving capital efficiency and composability; SP provides a fixed-rate yield management tool.
2. **ERC20 Token Traders & Liquidity Providers (OutSwap):**
   * **Characteristics:** Active decentralized exchange users, including retail users seeking low-slippage trades and professionals looking to earn income by providing liquidity. Highly sensitive to MEV attacks, transaction fees, and security.
   * **Behavioral Preferences:** Seek an efficient, fair trading environment; wish to earn competitive returns by providing liquidity and avoid exploitation by MEV attackers. Some users may participate in ecosystem growth through referral mechanisms.
   * **Outrun's Appeal:** The built-in MEV Guard provides strong trading protection, ensuring fairness; the referral commission engine incentivizes user participation, bringing additional income to LPs.
3. **Startup Project Teams & Early Investors (FFLaunch):**
   * **Characteristics:**
     * **Project Teams:** Seek a sustainable, community-driven **cold start** and **liquidity bootstrapping mechanism**, along with continuous **community funding** (ongoing revenue streams). They also want to distribute airdrops via **Fair Airdrops (FAirdrops)** to maintain user stickiness.
     * **Investors:** Have a lower risk tolerance and aim to avoid the drawbacks of traditional launchpads, such as **"rat-trading," insider trading, and project rug pulls**, to ensure investment security.
   * **Behavioral Preferences:**
     * **Project Teams:** Wish to quickly attract community attention and early users, build trust, and find sustainable funding sources and user participation mechanisms. They also want to establish highly sticky and active user communities.
     * **Investors:** Tend to participate in risk-controlled investments where they can preserve their principal even if the project performs poorly, while still achieving high returns. They prefer transparent and fair token issuance processes.
   * **Outrun's Appeal:** Outrun's "**risk-free**" fair launch mechanism fundamentally resolves **rug pull** and **insider trading** issues, providing unprecedented security for both parties. The ability to **preserve principal even if the project performs poorly** attracts a wider range of capital with lower risk appetites.
4. **Memecoin Community Core Members & Builders (Memeverse):**

    * **Characteristics:** Not satisfied with pure Memecoin speculation; craves to imbue Memecoins with real value and long-term viability. Desires community ownership, rather than being at the mercy of manipulators without recourse. Possesses passion for community governance, decentralized collaboration, and Web3's social applications.
    * **Behavioral Preferences:** Actively participates in DAO governance, strategizing for community development. Seeks to earn DeFi yields by staking Memecoins. Is committed to transforming Memecoins from speculative tools into vehicles for a "decentralized society" with cultural and practical value, accelerating the mass adoption of DAOs.
    * **Outrun's Appeal:** Provides a Memecoin staking mechanism (ERC4626 yield vaults) and a robust DAO governance framework. This combines Memecoins with real yields and collective decision-making, giving them deeper social and economic significance. Its grand vision of building a "decentralized society" attracts those hoping to leverage Web3 innovations to reshape human relationships and collaboration models.

    By deeply understanding and precisely meeting the needs and preferences of these diverse target users, Outrun can build a vibrant, highly sticky ecosystem, enabling continuous user growth and value capture.
