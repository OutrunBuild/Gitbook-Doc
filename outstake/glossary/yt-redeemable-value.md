# YT Redeemable Value

The interest generated by yield-bearing tokens in the staking pool will continuously accumulate over time into the corresponding Yield Pool. Users can burn YT at any time to redeem their corresponding accumulated yields.

The redeemable value of YT refers to the actual accumulated yields that each YT token can currently redeem from the Yield Pool.

**YT Redeemable Value Calculation Formula:**

<p align="center"><span class="math">RV = \frac{Y_{accrued}}{YT_{supply}}</span></p>

* $$Y_{accrued}:$$  This refers to the total yields accumulated in the Yield Pool from all yield-bearing assets in the staking pool up to the current point in time. This value is dynamic, **increasing as the interest from staked yield-bearing assets grows and decreasing as users burn YT**.
* $$YT_{supply}:$$  This is the total amount of YT tokens currently circulating in the market.

In simple terms, the redeemable value of YT is: if all accumulated yields in the Yield Pool were settled now and distributed proportionally to all YT token holders, the amount of yields each YT token would receive.
