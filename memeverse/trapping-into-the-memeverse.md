# Trapping into the Memeverse

Alright, let's trap into the Memeverse.

Inspired by FFLaunch, Memeverse shares many similarities and can be seen as the public version of FFLaunch, specifically designed as a protocol for Memecoin, while inheriting all the advantages of FFLaunch. Compared to the entry barriers of FFLaunch, anyone can create their own Memecoin on Memeverse, adhering to the principles of Fair & Free. Due to the no entry barriers for Memeverse, and for security reasons, Memeverse has removed the customizable token generator interface. Instead, a generic token template is used to create Memecoins, allowing users to deploy them effortlessly through our website UI without any programming knowledge required.

For details regarding FFLaunch features, please refer to the comprehensive FFLaunch documentation.

### Why choose Memeverse?

Currently, there are many ways to issue Memecoins on the market, but these methods are often primitive and lack innovation. They also pose significant risks such as insider trading, rug pulls and has a serious gambling nature, creating no new value. In contrast to competitors in the market, Memeverse offers the following advantages:

* **Unique Symbol Ensures Scarcity**: Each Memecoin's symbol in Memeverse is unique, ensuring naming scarcity. This helps Memecoins (especially those created for news-driven trading) to have stronger recognition and appeal in the market.
* **FFLaunch Style Launch**: Memeverse launches through FFLaunch to avoid common risks such as fraud, insider trading, and rug pulls in traditional Memecoin issuance. This method ensures that all participants start on an equal footing, reducing their risk and providing a relatively safe way to participate.
* **Capturing Staking Rewards from Outstake**: Memeverse allows users to earn native staking yields generated by Outstake through minting Memecoin, which enhances capital efficiency. This enables investors to participate in Memecoin activities while also engaging in DeFi staking. This mechanism not only attracts novice investors to DeFi but also brings more potential users to the DeFi ecosystem.
* **Continuous Financial Support and Gas Fee Refund Returns**: Memecoin creators can receive ongoing financial support from trading fees generated by locked liquidity and enjoy a rebate of all gas fees incurred on that Memecoin (Only Blast L2). These forms of revenue provide economic support and incentives for the continued operation of the Memecoin community or for developing utility functions for Memecoin.
* **Memeverse Referral Service**: Memeverse allows users to generate one-click direct referral links for Memecoin. Clicking the link will take users directly to the Memecoin details page. When the referred users trade using the link, the referrer will receive a commission from the protocol fees.
* **Memeverse Reserve Fund**: The Memeverse Reserve Fund can provide price support, and anyone can use the funds in the reserve fund. Additionally, during continuous repurchases, a portion of Memecoin will be permanently destroyed, and the reserve fund will continuously grow in size when Memecoin is sold.
* **PPP Low-Risk Attracts More Capital Participation**: Compared to the prevalent high PVP sentiment in the current Memecoin market, participating in the Memeverse genesis involves lower risk. Due to the features of FFLaunch and the presence of reserve funds, even in the almost impossible extreme scenarios, investors can retain most of their investment, and this predictability in mathematics eliminates uncertain risks. This low-risk characteristic attracts capital with lower risk tolerance to invest in Memecoin, providing more abundant liquidity for Memecoin issued through Memeverse. This lays a solid foundation for the development of Memecoin.
* **Community Support and Viral Spread from Genesis Users**: Every participant in the Memecoin genesis launch becomes a strong advocate for the Memecoin community. They not only hold tokens but also possess liquidity shares locked during the genesis period, making them shareholders during this time. This fundamental drive encourages them to promote the Memecoin they participated in during the liquidity locking period. This mechanism helps reduce operational barriers during the Memecoin community's cold start phase and promotes rapid viral adoption.

In summary, Memeverse provides **innovative issuance methods, staking reward mechanisms, economic support measures, and community-driven forces**, offering new perspectives and solutions for Memecoin development. These advantages not only enhance the market competitiveness of Memecoins but also have the potential to drive the entire industry towards **greater transparency, security, and sustainability**.
