# FFLaunch

### A truly community-driven token financing paradigm

The first Fair and Free Launch standard on the EVM, inspired by the inscription.

FFLaunch combines OutrunDao's other two products, "OutStake" and "OutSwap," leveraging their strengths to create the fairest token issuance method in history.

Users can mint [**UPT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/upt.md) by staking and locking **yield-bearing tokens**. Of course, they can also directly purchase UPT in the market. UPT will be divided into **two parts**. When participating in the genesis event, one part will form trading pairs with the reserved project tokens and provide liquidity on the **Outrun AMM**. The liquidity provider (LP) tokens will be locked for a certain period of time, and at the same time, [**POL**](proof-of-liquidity-token.md) **tokens** will be minted. Another part of UPT will form trading pairs with some of the minted POL tokens and deploy them on the Outrun AMM, and then they will be locked for a certain period of time. Finally, users can claim the remaining POL tokens. **After the lock-up period expires, users can redeem the liquidity that they have added to the trading pairs of project tokens and POL tokens**. This is equivalent to users obtaining these tokens for **free** while continuously participating in the entire liquidity building process of the project.

For the project team, the funds they raise come from the trading fees collected by the trading pairs during the LP lockup period.With the core fundamental requirements mentioned above, we also provide customizable callee interfaces for project teams to support the flexibility of FFLaunch. This allows project teams to build their own unique launch logic on top of the Fair And Free foundation.

### Not everything has a fixed price

Compared to traditional ICOs or IDOs, the FFLaunch model is **fairer** and more **investor-friendly**. Investors can obtain the project's tokens for free, while also preventing the project team from conducting **rug pulls** or abandoning further development of the product after raising a large amount of funds, as is common in traditional IDOs. To raise further funds, project teams must continuously iterate on products during the LP lock-up period, encouraging users to trade their tokens. This facilitates sustained growth in cash flow.

Furthermore, the FFLaunch model fosters **community-driven** liquidity. Since tokens are essentially obtained for free, this encourages **more liquidity** to be pooled, thereby increasing the depth of the liquidity pool. This is crucial for a newly launched project.
