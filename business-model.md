# Business Model

## I. Introduction: The Dawn of a New DeFi Era

In the rapidly evolving landscape of the digital economy, a well-conceived business model is the cornerstone of any innovative product's success. It not only clearly outlines how the product precisely meets market demands but also charts its path toward sustainable profitability and long-term growth. Outrun, as a pioneer in next-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3, is leveraging its forward-thinking business model to unlock higher, more flexible, and more secure DeFi yields, while injecting unprecedented value and vitality into the Web3 ecosystem. This article will delve into how Outrun's unique ecosystem design allows it to stand out in a fiercely competitive market, positioning it as a pivotal force in the future of Web3.

***

## II. Outrun's Core Value: The Synergistic Effect of Four Pillars

Outrun's core competitiveness stems from the sophisticated synergy of its four modules: [**OutStake**](outstake/), [**OutSwap**](outswap/), [**FFLaunch**](fflaunch/), and [**Memeverse**](memeverse/). These aren't isolated components; instead, they empower one another, collectively weaving a complete and highly efficient closed-loop ecosystem.

### A. OutStake: Revolutionizing Yield Tokenization

OutStake aims to completely transform the yield model of traditional interest-bearing assets like **LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens)**, **yield-bearing stablecoins**, and **RWAs (Real World Assets)**. It introduces a yield-linked token model that cleverly unlocks the liquidity of staked assets, allowing them to be widely used across various DeFi scenarios.

**Core Innovations and Market Advantages:**

* **Perpetual Lifecycle Tokens:** Unlike tokens in existing protocols (such as **Pendle**) that have expiration dates, OutStake's [**Principal Tokens (PT)**](outstake/yield-tokenization/pt.md) and [**Yield Tokens (YT)**](outstake/yield-tokenization/yt.md) have a "**perpetual lifecycle**" and are both standard **ERC20 tokens**. This design fundamentally solves the pain point of **liquidity fragmentation**, significantly enhancing composability and flexibility, enabling seamless integration into the broader DeFi ecosystem.
* [**Omnichain Universal Principal Token (UPT)**](outstake/yield-tokenization/upt.md)**:** **UPT** is an innovative, **omnichain universal principal token** backed by multiple yield-bearing tokens that share the same underlying asset. This design **allows liquidity to be shared across different yield-bearing tokens of the same underlying asset**. It's also a crucial component of the Outrun ecosystem – an **omnichain stablecoin**. UPT aims to be a cornerstone in the DeFi space, demonstrating exceptional stability in cross-chain transfers and DeFi composability. This makes it an efficient, low-volatility medium for value transfer and settlement, significantly boosting the capital efficiency and composability of the entire Outrun ecosystem.
* [**Staked Position (SP)**](outstake/yield-tokenization/sp.md) **and** [**Point Yield Token (PYT)**](outstake/yield-tokenization/pyt.md)**:** **SP tokens** represent the right to redeem locked staked positions upon maturity and come with built-in **price discovery** and **fixed yield rate** mechanisms. **PYT**, on the other hand, focuses on capturing external protocol point yields, with the final interpretation rights belonging to the external protocols.

OutStake's design philosophy, particularly its emphasis on "**real yield**" and its avoidance of liquidity fragmentation and the impact of protocol incentive points, makes it more appealing to investors **seeking stable and sustainable returns** and to developers **pursuing composability**.

### B. OutSwap: The Future of Intelligent Trading

Outrun AMM V1 introduces several innovations built upon the constant product AMM model, aiming to optimize user experience and address core challenges in decentralized trading.

**Innovative Features and Strategic Positioning:**

* [**Referral Commission Engine**](outswap/referral-commission-engine.md)**:** Outrun AMM is the market's first automated market maker to integrate a **composable on-chain referral commission engine**. This engine is open to everyone, with rewards sourced from protocol fees, ensuring that **Liquidity Providers (LPs)**' interests remain unharmed. Simultaneously, it effectively incentivizes trading volume growth, leading to higher income for LPs.
* [**MEV Guard**](outswap/mev-guard/)**:** Outrun AMM natively integrates an innovative **on-chain MEV Guard module**. This significantly increases the cost and complexity of MEV attacks, substantially reducing common DEX MEV behaviors such as **launch sniping attack** and **sandwich attacks**. It also allows LPs to capture a portion of MEV revenue. This not only enhances trading security but also transforms LPs' potential losses into gains.

OutSwap chose the constant product AMM for its initial version to prioritize support for **long-tail assets** and lower the barrier to entry for non-professional market makers. This strategy helps attract a broader user base, building a more decentralized and robust liquidity foundation, with plans to introduce new models like **DLAMM** and **Order Book** in the future.

### C. FFLaunch: Nova Paradigm of Fair Launch

FFLaunch is the first "**risk-free**" fundraising launchpad designed for **early-stage startup teams**, adhering to **fair** and **free** issuance standards. Through its unique mechanisms, it completely transforms the token launch paradigm, offering unprecedented security and fairness to both investors and project teams.

**Core Mechanisms and Value Proposition:**

* [**Proof-of-Liquidity (POL) Tokens**](fflaunch/proof-of-liquidity-token/)**:** Investors participate in FFLaunch by receiving **POL tokens**, rather than project tokens, which represent their share in the locked genesis liquidity pool. POL tokens can be traded before the liquidity is unlocked, allowing investors to flexibly manage risk and lock in current profits, effectively reducing their opportunity cost of holding.
* **Prevention of Insider Trading and Rug Pulls:** Upon token listing, all tokens are added to the liquidity pool, fundamentally eliminating the possibility of **insider trading**. During the liquidity lock-up period, no new tokens can be minted or issued, effectively preventing project teams from executing **rug pulls** by exploiting initial user liquidity.
* **"Risk-Free" Returns for "Free" Token Acquisition:** After the liquidity lock-up period ends, investors can redeem their genesis liquidity by burning POL tokens, which is equivalent to "**acquiring tokens for free**". Even if the project completely fails, investors can still recover their initial investment, thereby achieving a "risk-free return." This mechanism significantly reduces the risks associated with early-stage investments, attracting broader capital participation.
* **Fostering User Stickiness:** Genesis users are considered shareholders during the liquidity lock-up period. This incentivizes them to continuously pay attention to and promote their investments, aiding the project's "cold start" and early community development.

FFLaunch's innovative model directly addresses the prevalent issues of fraud and manipulation in cryptocurrency issuance. It provides a more sustainable and less speculative foundation for new projects, which is crucial for startup teams seeking long-term value creation and mainstream adoption.

### D. Memeverse: From Speculation to Value Transformation

Memeverse is an **omnichain Memecoin launch platform** built upon the FFLaunch concept. It deeply integrates Memecoins with **DeFi** and **DAO governance**, aiming to transform Memecoins from purely speculative assets into **sustainable value digital assets**, while simultaneously building a **decentralized society** with Memecoins as its vehicle.

**Strategic Innovations and Long-Term Vision:**

* **FFLaunch-Powered Launch:** Memeverse launches via the **FFLaunch method**, designed to circumvent common risks in traditional Memecoin issuances such as **fraud, insider trading and rug pulls**. This approach ensures all participants are on an equal footing, reducing their risk and providing a secure way to engage.
* [**Memecoin Staking**](memeverse/meme-defi-dao/memecoin-staking.md) **(ERC4626 Yield Vaults):** Each Memecoin on the platform corresponds to an **ERC4626 yield vault**. Holders can deposit Memecoins into the vault to mint yield-bearing tokens and earn continuous returns from market-making income (the Memecoin portion) and other application scenarios. The UPT portion of theised genesis liquidity market-making income then flows into the **Memecoin DAO Treasury**.
* **Community-Driven** [**DAO Governance**](memeverse/meme-defi-dao/memecoin-dao-governance/)**:** Memeverse's DAO governance aims to shift Memecoins **from speculative frenzies to a value co-creation paradigm**. Staked Memecoins grant users governance rights, allowing them to vote on the use of treasury funds (e.g., public affairs, DeSci, venture investments, ecosystem hackathons, utility development, Meme marketing campaigns) to enhance ecosystem impact and revenue.
* [**DAO Governance Cycle Incentivizer**](memeverse/meme-defi-dao/memecoin-dao-governance/dao-governance-cycle-incentives.md)**:** The unique DAO governance cycle incentivizer directly benefits community members for active governance by linking treasury revenue distribution to governance participation. This **ignites enthusiasm, improves decision-making quality, and strengthens a sense of belonging**, fostering a truly community-driven decentralized autonomous organization.
* [**Sustainable Community Growth**](memeverse/meme-defi-dao/sustainable-community-growth.md)**:** **20% of genesis funds** and **25% of the total Memecoin supply** are directly allocated to the **Memecoin DAO Treasury**. This strengthens the fundamental backing value of Memecoins and aligns the interests of the DAO with the Memecoin. This provides a sustainable financial foundation for **community-driven growth**.
* [**Omnichain Interoperability**](memeverse/omnichain-interoperability.md) **and Referral Services:** Supported by LayerZero, Memecoins achieve **omnichain liquidity**, allowing users to **register**, **genesis**, **stake**, and **trade** on any blockchain where Memeverse modules are deployed. Simultaneously, users can generate one-click referral links to earn commissions from protocol fees, effectively driving user acquisition and trading volume.

**Long-Term Vision: Building a Decentralized Society**

Memeverse's ultimate vision extends far beyond Memecoin issuance. It aims to deeply integrate Web3's native values—decentralization, transparency, and programmable trust mechanisms—into real-world economic and social systems, thereby constructing a complete decentralized society.

1. [**From On-Chain to Real-World Adoption**](memeverse/the-endgame-of-memecoin/from-onchain-to-real-world.md) **and Decentralized Society:** Memeverse's goal is to move beyond the tokenization of attention assets, embedding Web3's core values into the real world by **rebuilding human relationships** through new collaboration models. This means any activity requiring human collaboration, regardless of scale, can be realized through the decentralized communities built by Memeverse. These communities will collectively form a complete decentralized society. Ultimately, Memecoin holders can proudly identify as "citizens of a decentralized nation."
2. **Community-Driven Value Co-creation and the "Build and Earn" Paradigm:** Memeverse completely transforms traditional top-down startup models, placing user consensus and demand as the core driving forces. Users are both the proposers of needs and ideas, and the implementers of solutions (entrepreneurs), while also participating in decision-making through staking (investors/shareholders). This model converts speculative momentum into ecosystem building value, fostering a "Build and Earn" paradigm.
3. **Shifting User Mindset and Cultural Vehicle:** Through **FFLaunch** (fairness), **staking** (utility and returns), and **DAO governance** (participation and ownership), Memeverse shifts the perception of Memecoins from mere speculative tools to digital assets with multiple values and sustainable development potential. This allows Memecoins to become a "vehicle for social civilization"—an on-chain tool carrying community culture, values, and collective memory, with the ability to continuously evolve.

Memeverse's core innovation lies in **monetizing** the inherent community-driven nature of Memecoin through decentralized mechanisms such as staking and DAO governance. By allocating genesis funds and ongoing market-making revenues to the DAO treasury, Memeverse provides a sustainable financial foundation for community-led growth. This directly addresses the structural flaws of "**value hollowing**" and "**governance absence**" in traditional Memecoins. For investors, Memeverse offers a structured framework to capture value from community participation, transforming speculative interest into productive capital and decentralized collaboration. This creates a highly scalable model for launching and sustaining viral, community-driven projects, thereby entering **a vast yet untapped market**.

Outrun has built a multi-dimensional, sustainable profit model, which translates to stronger risk resilience and broader growth potential.

Outrun's diversified revenue framework captures various value streams generated within its ecosystem to ensure sustainable development:

* **OutSwap Transaction Fees:** OutSwap directly generates revenue by charging fees on user transactions. A portion of this income is allocated for protocol operations, another for referral commission payments, and the remainder is distributed to LPs. This forms a primary revenue source for the Outrun ecosystem.
* **OutStake Yield Commissions:** Outrun can charge small service fees when yield tokens are created, traded, or when yield products are recomposed. More importantly, through the widespread adoption of UPT and its status as an omnichain value transfer medium, Outrun can capture the derivative value generated by the liquidity network.
* **FFLaunch Platform Service Fees:** Outrun may charge service fees or protocol usage fees to projects conducting token issuances and fundraising through its FFLaunch platform, in return for providing a secure and efficient launch environment. FFLaunch will also serve as a traffic entry point for the Outrun ecosystem.

The combined functionalities of OutStake (**Yield infrastructure**), OutSwap (**Trading infrastructure**), FFLaunch (**Launch infrastructure**), and Memeverse (**Community infrastructure**) indicate that Outrun is building an "**ecosystem as a service**." It provides foundational tools for other projects and communities to build upon, rather than merely being a standalone application. This positions Outrun as a **base layer for the next wave of Web3 innovation**. By offering a comprehensive, integrated, and secure suite of tools for yield, trading, launching, and community-driven development, Outrun can capture value from various future projects and users built within its ecosystem, leading to **exponential growth potential**.

### V. Outrun's Future Vision

Outrun is actively **shaping the future of Web3**, not merely participating in its current landscape. We continuously push the boundaries of existing Web3 paradigms by tackling fundamental challenges and introducing innovative solutions, thereby building a **powerful and interconnected ecosystem**. This attracts users seeking superior financial products and projects looking for fair, secure, community-driven launch and growth platforms.

Our strategic focus on **sustainable revenue models**, **user protection**, and **the construction of a decentralized society** ensures Outrun's long-term growth and resilience within the evolving Web3 economy. We're transforming Memecoins from speculative assets into **"vehicles of social consensus,"** and our commitment to enabling **"**&#x6D;ass entrepreneurshi&#x70;**"**—and indeed, **any form of decentralized collaboration**—profoundly reflects our understanding that Web3's potential extends far beyond current limitations.

Outrun is building a **composite ecosystem** that transcends traditional Web3 projects. It not only addresses current market pain points but also, through its forward-thinking design, paints a clear blueprint for the future development of Web3 and **the real-world adoption of its native values**.
