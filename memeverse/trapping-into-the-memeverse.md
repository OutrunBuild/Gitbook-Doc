# Trapping into the Memeverse

Alright, let's trapping into the Memeverse.

**Memeverse** was inspired by **FFLaunch**. They have many similarities, but Memeverse has more functions. It is a protocol specifically designed for Memecoin and also incorporates all the advantages of FFLaunch.

Memeverse is built based on LayerZero. Users can choose to deploy Memecoins, [**POL**](../fflaunch/proof-of-liquidity-token.md) of Memecoin and their liquidity on multiple blockchains simultaneously. These tokens can be transferred seamlessly across chains, which helps Memecoins reach more potential users and gain more liquidity. This is of great significance for the spread and community building of Memecoins.

Compared with the access threshold of FFLaunch, anyone can create their own Memecoins on Memeverse. All these tokens adhere to the **Fair&Free** concept. Due to the absence of an access threshold on Memeverse, for security considerations, Memeverse has removed the customizable token generator interface and uses a universal token template to create Memecoins. Users don't need any programming knowledge. They can complete all the deployments with just one click using our website UI.

The tokens deployed on FFLaunch are basically utility tokens, which have inherent value in themselves and relatively good liquidity. However, most Memecoins lack practical value, **and their price fluctuations are greatly influenced by token liquidity**. Therefore, a portion of the liquidity of the Memecoins deployed on Memeverse will be **locked permanently** to support the **continuous liquidity** of the Memecoins.

Memeverse is not just a token launch platform, but also a **Memecoin Staking** protocol, which perfectly combines Memecoins with **DeFi** and brings more benefits to Memecoin holders. Each type of Memecoin has a corresponding yield vault that complies with the **ERC4626 standard** on the genesis chain. Memecoin holders can deposit their Memecoins into the vault to mint yield-bearing tokens based on Memecoin. **The revenue of the vault mainly comes from the Memecoin portion of the market-making income of the locked liquidity** (the vault income can only be in Memecoins, while the UPT portion belongs to the token creators). Meanwhile, the Memecoin vault also opens up its composability, **allowing the community to introduce more sources of income** (for example, developing practical functions for Memecoins to generate income). For some mature Memecoins, their yield-bearing tokens can directly join the OutStake ecosystem to further develop their DeFi potential.

The market-making income from the locked liquidity is divided into two parts. One part is in the form of Memecoins and belongs to the yield vault, while the other part is in the form of UPTs and belongs to the token creators. The advantage of such a design is that the continuous income obtained by the token creators is in UPTs rather than Memecoins, thus preventing the token creators from obtaining a large amount of Memecoins as a single entity and then manipulating the market. Memecoins should belong to the community. And community members who hold Memecoins can obtain more Memecoins through staking, which helps community holders build a stronger consensus.

### Why choose Memeverse?

Currently, there are many Memecoins launch methods in the market, but these methods are quite **primitive and lack innovation**. They also face **significant risks**, such as **insider trading** (Some platforms even promote **“immediate purchase within the same transaction as the token issuance”** as a major selling point.), **Rug Pulls**, and a **strong element of gambling**, without creating any new value. Compared to its competitors in the market, Memeverse offers the following advantages:

* **Unique Symbol Ensures Scarcity**: The symbol of each Memecoin is unique throughout the **omnichain Memeverse**, which ensures the scarcity in naming. This can help Memecoins generated by **news trading**, for example, **have stronger recognition and appeal in the market**.
* **FFLaunch Style Launch**: Memeverse launches through **FFLaunch** to avoid common risks such as **fraud, insider trading, and rug pulls** in traditional Memecoin issuance. This method ensures that all participants start on an equal footing, reducing their risk and providing a relatively safe way to participate.
* **Capturing Staking Yields from OutStake**: Memeverse allows users to stake yield-bearing tokens to mint UPTs and simultaneously obtain the staking yields generated by OutStake. This improves the utilization rate of funds, enabling investors to participate in the activities of Memecoins while also engaging in **DeFi** staking. This mechanism not only attracts novice investors to participate in DeFi but also brings more potential users to the DeFi ecosystem.
* **Memecoin Staking and Restaking**: Memecoin holders can stake their memecoins into the vault to mint **yield-bearing tokens** of memecoins that comply with the ERC4626 standard. The value of these tokens will accumulate over time. Meanwhile, they can also stake and lock the yield-bearing tokens of memecoins again in OutStake, thus obtaining **more yields and composability**.
* **Continuous Financial Support**: Memecoin creators can obtain continuous financial support from the **market-making earnings** generated by the locked liquidity. These forms of income provide certain economic support and incentives for the continuous operation of the Memecoin community or for the development of practical functions for Memecoins.
* **Memeverse Referral Service**: Memeverse allows users to generate **one-click direct referral links** for Memecoin. Clicking the link will take users directly to the Memecoin details page. When the referred users trade using the link, the referrer will receive a **commission** from the protocol fees.
* **PPP Low-Risk Attracts More Capital Participation**: Compared with the severe **PVP** sentiment among the current Memecoins on the market, participating in the genesis of Memeverse entails lower risks. Thanks to the features of **FFLaunch** and the existence of the **Memecoin vault**, even in extreme circumstances, investors can preserve the vast majority of their investments, and the risks are **predictable**. This low-risk characteristic attracts funds with a lower risk preference to invest in Memecoins, providing more sufficient liquidity for the Memecoins issued through Memeverse, which lays a solid foundation for the development of Memecoins.
* **Community Support and Viral Spread from Genesis Users**: Every participant in the Memecoin genesis launch becomes a strong advocate for the Memecoin community. They **not only hold tokens but also possess liquidity shares locked during the genesis period**, making them shareholders during this time. This fundamental drive encourages them to promote the Memecoin they participated in during the liquidity locking period. This mechanism helps reduce operational barriers during the Memecoin community's cold start phase and promotes **rapid viral adoption**.

In summary, Memeverse provides **innovative issuance methods, staking reward mechanisms, economic support measures, and community-driven forces**, offering new perspectives and solutions for Memecoin development. These advantages not only enhance the market competitiveness of Memecoins but also have the potential to drive the entire industry towards **greater transparency, security, and sustainability**.
