# OutStake

**OutStake** is a protocol entirely built around **yield-bearing tokens**, introducing the first **non-USD stablecoin model** tied to **yields rates**. Compared to other yield token protocols in the market, such as **Pendle**, OutStake offers **greater flexibility, enhanced composability**, and provides **higher returns along with multiple sources of income**. The assets supported by OutStake form the foundational support for the Outrun ecosystem, providing a stable base for the entire system. Specifically, OutStake operates as follows:

1. **A New Staking Model Based on Yield-bearing Tokens:** OutStake adopts a unique design that allows users to control the yields generated by their assets. Through OutStake, users can mint Principal Tokens **(UPT)** by staking their assets, thereby unlocking liquidity for their staked assets and utilizing these tokens across a range of DeFi applications.
2. **Interest-Rate-Linked Stablecoin (YT)**: The value of an interest-rate-linked stablecoin is directly tied to interest rates. The economic model built around it provides stakers with higher income and a variety of revenue sources. It is highly composable, allowing developers to create new products around it, thereby enriching the Outrun ecosystem.
3. **Universal asset principal token (UPT)**: UPT is a omnichain universal principal token supported by **LayerZero**, enabling it to be seamlessly transferred across different blockchains to amplify its network effect. The Principal Tokens (PT) of **the same underlying asset type** can be converted into UPT (such as PT-Stone, PT-stETH, PT-rETH, etc.). This allows the UPT liquidity of different yield-bearing tokens under the same underlying asset type to be **shared**, thereby enhancing the combinability of UPT and reducing the difficulty of liquidity accumulation for yield-bearing tokens.
4. **Position Option Tokens(POT):** These option tokens represent the right to redeem the **yield-bearing token** at the end of its lock-up period. This option allows users to trade for a fixed interest rate without trading the **UPT** itself, thereby enhancing capital efficiency.
