# Project Team

#### As a Project Team Participating in FFLaunch

* **Continuous Fund Flow:** Project teams can receive ongoing funding support from transaction fees generated during the LP lock period, incentivizing them to continuously improve and maintain the project, especially suitable for **early-stage** projects **Pre-TGE**.
* **Enhanced Market Liquidity:** Since tokens are obtained for free, more users are attracted to participate, increasing the depth of the liquidity pool and enhancing market liquidity.
* **Market Attention:** FFLaunch provides a **fairer and risk-free** community funding model, attracting more market attention, especially from investors skeptical of traditional **ICO/IDO** models.
* **Flexibility and Innovation:** Project teams can use **ITokenGenerator** interface (**subject to review**) to customize their launch logic, meeting specific needs and enhancing the project's uniqueness and appeal.
* **User Stickiness:** Since investors hold shares of the liquidity locked during the FFLaunch genesis period, each genesis user is considered a shareholder during the liquidity lock period. This ensures that users continuously monitor their investments and potentially provide exposure opportunities for the project, significantly reducing operational obstacles for the project's cold start.
