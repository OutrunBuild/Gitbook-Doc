# SY

SY is a vault token based on the [ERC5115](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5115) standard designed to encapsulate yield-bearing tokens. It can wrap any yield-bearing token and provides a standardized interface for interacting with the yield-generating mechanisms of any yield-bearing token.

As all SYs have the same mechanism, Outstake interacts with SY as the main interface to all yield-bearing tokens.OutStake automatically converts yield-bearing tokens into SY and vice versa. This process happens automatically behind the scenes, making users feel as if theyâ€™re interacting directly with their yield-bearing tokens instead of having to manually manage the conversion between SY and yield-bearing tokens.
