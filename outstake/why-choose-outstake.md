# Why choose Outstake?

1. **New Staking Model**

Outstake introduces a new staking model based on native yield tokens, allowing users to control the native yield generated by their assets.

Users can mint Staked Tokens to release liquidity for their staked assets and use them in various DeFi applications.

2. **Innovative Stablecoin Mechanism**

Outstake has designed a new algorithmic stablecoin tied to the yield rate, diverging from traditional USD-pegged stablecoins.

The economic model built around this stablecoin provides stakers with higher returns and multiple sources of income compared to traditional LSD protocols and yield token protocols.

3. **Powerful Composability**

The YT in Outrun offers high composability, allowing developers to build new products based on YT, thereby enriching the Outrun ecosystem.

4. **Position Options Token (POT)**

POT represents the redemption rights of native yield tokens at the end of the lock-up period. Through POT, users can trade for fixed-rate rights without directly trading PT itself, improving capital efficiency.

5. **Flash Loan Functionality**

Outstake offers flash loan functionality, providing stakers with higher yield potential from their native yield tokens.
