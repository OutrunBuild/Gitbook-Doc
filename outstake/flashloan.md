# FlashLoan

FlashLoan is a new way of borrowing assets on the blockchain. Unlike traditional collateralized loans, FlashLoan requires no collateral, credit scoring, or management to process unsecured loans. FlashLoan is often used for on-chain arbitrage, liquidation, and other activities.

FlashLoan leverages atomicity to allow users to borrow without providing collateral. There are two important considerations to mention. Firstly, whenever you borrow assets in a FlashLoan, you must pay a usage fee. Secondly, the loan must be repaid in the same transaction it was borrowed.

Outrun offers FlashLoan functionality, where arbitrageurs can borrow the user's pledged ETH or USDB through the provided interface and repay it in the same transaction. This can provide additional sources of income for stakers and improve capital efficiency.
