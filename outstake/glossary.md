### **Native Yield Token**

Native Yield Token is a general term referring to any token that can generate yield or has potential yield. Examples include Stone, slisBNB, stETH, Blast ETH, GLP, LP liquidity tokens, and so on.

### **Native Asset Token**

Native Asset Token refers to the underlying asset token of a Native Yield Token. For example, the Native Asset Token for Stone, stETH, and rETH is ETH.

### **SY = Standardized Yield Token**

SY is a vault token based on the [ERC5115](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5115) standard designed to encapsulate native yield tokens. It can wrap any native yield token and provides a standardized interface for interacting with the yield-generating mechanisms of any native yield token.

In OutStake, staking SY and specifying a lock-up period will mint three types of tokens: **POT (Position Option Token)**, **UPT (Principal Token)**, and **YT (Yield Token)**.

### **PT = Principal Token**

PT is the principal component separated from the Native Yield Token. Holding PT represents ownership of the principal, which can be redeemed for the Native Yield Token upon the maturity of the [POT](glossary.md#pot-position-option-token) (Position Option Token).

Unlike other protocols, OutStake's PT is a standard ERC20 token with no expiration date. When staking for different durations of SY, the same PT token is minted, but the quantity minted will vary slightly depending on the staking period. Each native yield token will have a corresponding PT token.

### **UPT = Universal Principal Token**

The Universal Principal Token (UPT) is an omnichain universal principal token supported by the LayerZero protocol. Unlike the situation where there is one Principal Token (PT) corresponding to each native yield token, UPT can be directly converted from PT. Each type of UPT can be converted from multiple PTs supported by the same native asset. For example, PT-Stone, PT-stETH, and PT-BETH can be converted into UETH. UPT manages which PT tokens can be converted into itself through a whitelist.

### **YT = Yield Token**

YT is the yield component separated from the Native Yield Token. Holding YT represents ownership of all the yield generated by the underlying asset, and it can be burned at any time to redeem the accumulated native yield in the current yield pool.

Unlike other protocols, OutStake's YT is a universal ERC20 token with no expiration date, and YTs minted from different staking times are the same token (with the same token contract address). Unlike UPT, each type of Native Yield Token mints a corresponding YT.

The redeemable value of YT (the native yield redeemable by burning YT) starts at zero. Over time, the yield pool will continuously accumulate the native yield of the staked assets, and the redeemable value of YT will continuously grow until it reaches a dynamic equilibrium state, fluctuating around the native yield rate of the Native Yield Token.

### **POT = Position Option Token**

POT is an option token based on the [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standard that is used to encapsulate a user's staked position. Holding a POT represents the right to redeem a position upon maturity. After the POT lock-up period expires, the POT can be burned along with the corresponding UPT to redeem the staked Native Yield Tokens. Since POT is based on the [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standard, it supports partial redemption of the position.

POT records the amount of staked Native Yield Tokens, the fixed principal value, and the number of minted PTs. Upon maturity, there is a fixed relationship between the amount of POT burned, the number of PTs, and the value of the principal being redeemed, thereby establishing a fixed interest rate. Trading POT allows one to trade the right to obtain a fixed interest rate.
