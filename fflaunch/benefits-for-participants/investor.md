#### As an Investor Participating in FFLaunch

* **Free Tokens:** Investors can mint tokens by staking **Native Yield Token**, without needing to purchase tokens directly, making the acquisition cost extremely low, effectively getting tokens for free.
* **Low-Risk Returns:** Investors' staked funds can be redeemed after the lock-up period, meaning that even if the project fails, investors can reclaim most of their initial investment, achieving very low-risk returns.
* **Preventing Front-Running and Dumping**: During the liquidity lock-up period, new tokens cannot be minted or released, preventing the project team from using initial users as exit liquidity.
* **Continuous Earnings:** During the lock-up period, staked **Native Yield Token** will generate native returns, distributed in the form of  **YieldToken(YT)**, providing investors with additional earnings.
* **Rug Pull Prevention:** The FFLaunch model prevents project teams from absconding with raised funds, ensuring fairer token distribution and protecting investors' rights.
* **Tradeable Liquidity Proof:** Investors mint tradeable liquidity proof tokens when they lock liquidity. They can trade these tokens at any time, thereby managing their risk while their liquidity remains locked.
