# Growth Is Part Of The Product

Whether it is Memecoin DAO or the entire Outrun ecosystem, growth is indispensable—from 0 to 1, and then from 1 to 100. The uniqueness of Outrun lies in the fact that it integrates growth itself into the product design, making it the core driving force of ecological development.

***

#### **From 0 to 1: A Fair Start**

Outrun ensures a fair starting environment through innovative mechanisms, fostering natural community growth:

* [**Proof of Liquidity (POL)**](../../fflaunch/proof-of-liquidity-token.md) **Tokens**: Before the token launch, no tokens are pre-circulated; all tokens are directly allocated to the liquidity pool.
* [**MEV Guard**](../../outswap/mev-guard/) **Protection**: Initial liquidity is safeguarded by MEV Guard, effectively preventing attacks from sniper bots.

In this equitable environment, growth from 0 to 1 occurs naturally. The first person to successfully buy tokens will not incur losses (despite MEV Guard restrictions), and early participants benefit as well. This attracts the initial group of users to join Memecoin DAO, with genesis members continuing to support the community, driving the initial growth from 0 to 1.

#### **From 1 to 100: Empowering the Treasury**

Imagine an extreme scenario where, after achieving growth from 0 to 1, Memecoin DAO’s progress stalls, and even genesis members stop supporting the community. How can Outrun help such a community continue to grow?

If the initial momentum is insufficient, Outrun adds another spark. To this end, Outrun restructured Memeverse by allocating 20% of the genesis funds directly to the Memecoin DAO treasury. This proportion was carefully determined to maximize impact. Why does this approach drive sustained community growth? Let’s compare:

1. **All Genesis Funds Used for Liquidity Deployment**

In this case, when all genesis funds are used to deploy liquidity for Memecoin and POL tokens, Memecoin’s **base support value** is its listing price. This means that even if all token holders sell after the launch, the token price will, at most, drop to its listing price. This price serves as the support level before liquidity is unlocked.

2. **20% of Genesis Funds Allocated to DAO Treasury**

In this scenario, the genesis funds are distributed as follows:

* **60%** for Memecoin liquidity deployment.
* **20%** for POL token liquidity deployment.
* **20%** directly to the Memecoin DAO treasury.

Here, Memecoin’s **base support value** includes not only its listing price but also a portion of the value held in the Memecoin DAO treasury. More importantly, due to [governance incentives cycle](memecoin-dao-governance/dao-governance-cycle-incentives.md), treasury revenue can be distributed to users who stake Memecoin and participate in governance. Since the proportion of tokens staked early is typically very low, Memecoin’s base support value can reach **at least 133%** of its listing price—or **even several times higher** (This does not include the staking rewards of Memecoin itself).

This design attracts more users to purchase tokens, stake them, and actively participate in community governance. It provides significant support for the community’s early-stage sustained growth.

Building on the above foundation, Outrun further strengthens the role of the DAO. We have observed that, although the DAO treasury benefits from Memecoin transaction fees and empowers Memecoin through governance, its revenue is closely tied to community and transaction activity. However, its responsibility for Memecoin’s price fluctuations is not fully aligned.To address this, Outrun has optimized the Memeverse design:

* After a successful genesis, Memecoin equivalent to 20% of the genesis funds is minted for the DAO treasury.
* Initially, the DAO treasury will hold both UPT (genesis funds) and Memecoin.

This adjustment yields the following advantages:

* **Enhancing Memecoin’s Base Support Value**: The Memecoin held by the treasury further bolsters the token’s intrinsic support.
* **Binding DAO and Memecoin Interests**: By directly holding Memecoin, the DAO’s fortunes are intertwined with the token’s price, incentivizing the DAO to more actively safeguard Memecoin’s value.
* **Supporting the Points-Based Incentive Program**: This lays the groundwork for Outrun’s new points-based **incentive program**, further amplifying the DAO’s influence within the ecosystem.
