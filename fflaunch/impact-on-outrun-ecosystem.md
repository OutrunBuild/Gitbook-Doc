# Impact on Outrun Ecosystem

### Increasing Outstake's TVL

Users participating in FFLaunch will stake their **Yield-bearing Tokens** in the Outstake protocol. These staked assets will form liquidity pools along with reserved tokens and will be locked for the same duration as the Outstake.

* Users will receive corresponding [**YT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/yt.md) after staking Yield-bearing Tokens.
* The total locked value (TVL) of Outstake will significantly increase due to the increase in staked assets.

FFLaunch enables the entire Outrun ecosystem to possess **extremely high capital efficiency**.

For example, stake 150 ETH to mint (nearly) **150 UETH**, and then by participating in the **Genesis** of FFLaunch, the 150 UETH will be divided into two parts.

1. **100 UETH** will form trading pairs with newly minted project tokens worth 100 UETH, thus minting [**POL**](proof-of-liquidity-token/) tokens worth **200 UETH**.
2. **50 UETH** will form trading pairs with POL tokens worth 50 UETH, thereby creating liquidity worth **100 UETH**.

Finally, users will obtain POL tokens worth **150 UETH**. The whole process has created a TVL and liquidity worth 600 ETH in total. Moreover, as transactions take place and the price of project tokens goes up, the TVL will also increase accordingly.

### Boosting Demand for UPTs

Participating in FFLaunch requires the use of UPT, which can be obtained either by staking more yield-bearing tokens or by purchasing directly on Outswap. These tokens will be locked within Outswap, and users will also need to use UPT when trading tokens.

* This directly increases market demand for UPT, thereby enhancing its adoption.
* The market-making revenue from the POL liquidity pool is permanently burned, which will permanently reduce the total supply of UPT.
* The permanent burning of UPT leads to the permanent staking of related yield-bearing tokens, thereby increasing the returns for all stakers.
* As the scarcity of UPT increases and its value rises, arbitrage opportunities are created, which will attract more people to stake on Oustake.
* Consequently, the TVL (Total Value Locked) and trading volume on Outswap will correspondingly increase.

### Cultivating User Usage Habits

During the prolonged period of locked liquidity, users will gradually become accustomed to trading with PTs.

* Long-term usage habits will help users accept and become accustomed to using these tokens, PTs will serve as the base tokens for trading pairs.
* With the addition of more trading pairs, an increasing number of users will use PTs, further driving the prosperity of the Outrun ecosystem.

### Breaking the Limitations of LSTs Usage Scenarios

Many Liquidity Staking Tokens (LSTs) face limitations in their usage scenarios, but FFLaunch provides an innovative way to overcome these limitations

* By creating new usage scenarios on Outstake and Outswap, FFLaunch enhances the practicality of LSTs.
* This strategy will attract more users, thereby increasing the activity and value of the entire ecosystem.

### Summary

FFLaunch increases Outstake's TVL by staking Yield-bearing Tokens, boosting the market demand for PT, and fostering user trading habits through long-term locked LPs. These measures will promote the prosperity of the Outrun ecosystem and break the current limitations of LST use cases, offering users more diverse and attractive options.
